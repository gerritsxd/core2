<p>A composite of action plans is obtained by summing present and absent action plans for the target behaviour. The subsequent approach can thereby be followed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Break downs the target behaviour in subbehaviours.</li>

<li>Create action plan composite: sum all present (=1) and absent (=0) action plans for the target behaviour</li>
</ol>
Participants‚Äô overall score expresses the degree action plans for the subbehaviours are present. A high score (e.g.&nbsp;6 out of 7) makes performance of the target behaviour more likely.

<p>The self-reported presence of action plans can be measured with dichotomous items asking if a specific plan is present (yes/no) for performance of a subbehaviour of the target behaviour. Answers on these items express if the participant has a plan to perform the subbehaviour according to the description provided. Items should specify when, where, and how the particular subbehaviour is performed.</p>
<p>Items measuring the presence of action plans start with a question stem that presents the situation about which the question is asking, followed by a detailed description of an action plan. Participants are asked to indicate if they have (yes=1/no=0) this specific action plan.</p>
<p>An example of a question stem followed by three items measuring the presence of three separate action plans for the target behaviour ‚Äúprotecting skin against UV radiation‚Äù is:</p>
<p>When you are going on a day trip this summer and large parts of your skin will be uncovered (e.g.&nbsp;at the pool or beach)‚Ä¶ 1) Do you plan to check one day or more beforehand if you have sunscreen at home? 2) Do you plan to check if you have sunscreen with you before leaving on the day trip? 3) Do you plan to use sunscreen every 2 hours?</p>

<a href="../../repo/constructs/actualControl_7blfql8r.html">Actual control</a>
</td>
<td>
<p>Researchers can utilize three complementary methods to assess the degree of actual control of a participant.</p>
<p>First, they can establish whether control factors, expressed by participants during the elicitation of salient beliefs, constitute actual (real) barriers or facilitators. Fishbein &amp; Ajzen (2010) on p.&nbsp;330-331 provide an example: ‚ÄòImagine that lack of public transportation is one of the salient factors mentioned as a possible barrier to getting a colonoscopy. We can try to establish if this is a realistic concern by checking with the transportation authorities on the kinds of public transportation available in the area. This would provide a measure of actual control with respect to this particular factor. In addition, we would also need to ascertain whether it is true that lack of public transportation actually interferes with getting to the doctor‚Äôs office‚Äô.</p>
<p>A second method to assess actual control is to gather background information about the population of interest; specifically concerning factors that may affect their performance of the target behaviour. Identification of these factors, whether personal or environmental, may be enhanced by consulting experts, members of the target population, and those closely living or working together with those members. As a result of increased comprehension of the study population, specific items can be formulated and included in the questionnaire that measure background factors relevant for performance of the target behaviour (e.g.&nbsp;highest level of education achieved), and/or a skills test (see next paragraph) may be developed, and as such these measures may be provide an (indirect) indication of the level of actual control.</p>
Finally, a third method to measure actual control is observation. The current gold standard for objectively measuring enacted behaviour is ‚Äòobservational coding‚Äô (i.e.&nbsp;‚Äòclassifying and quantifying verbal and nonverbal behavioural events or psychological states, irrespective of participants‚Äô reports or perceptions‚Äô). For example, registering actual control over the intention to be physically active by observing a participant‚Äôs choices during the day, e.g taking the stairs instead of the elevator, going by bike, and not by car, etc. As a consequence of its time and resource intensive nature, direct observation is not always a viable option. However, technical innovations have augmented the possiblities to track people‚Äôs behaviour, affect, and physiology outside of laboratory settings, e.g.&nbsp;an accelerometer may give an (objective) indication of a person‚Äôs ability to remain physically active over a determined time period. Another way of observing actual control is by designing a test in which participants‚Äô skills are put to the proof, e.g.&nbsp;by asking participants to prepare a r√©sum√© to test the presence of facilitating factors in applying for a job (example from p.&nbsp;331 of Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010).

<a href="../../repo/constructs/anticip_regret_79n2w1bj.html">Anticipated regret</a>
</td>
<td>
<p>Anticipated regret stems from the the expectation that the decision to perform or not perform the target behaviour will lead to feelings of regret. Therefore, anticipated regret with regard to the target behaviour is assessed via the subconstruct action regret (dct:action_regret_79n2w1bj) and inaction regret (dct:inaction_regret_79n2r0t0).</p>
<p>Whether assessment of action regret or inaction regret, or both, is more appropriate depends on the target behaviour and setting of the study. For example, if the target behaviour is ‚Äúexercising at least six times over the next two weeks‚Äù, then measuring inaction regret appears more logical: ‚ÄúIf you would not exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, how much regret would you feel?‚Äù, with anchors ‚Äúnone‚Äù (=0) and ‚Äúa lot‚Äù (=4). However, one can imagine situations (e.g.&nbsp;exercise as escapism, recovery from injury) in which it makes sense to also measure in the opposite direction (i.e.&nbsp;assess action regret): ‚ÄúIf you would exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, how much regret would you feel?‚Äù.</p>
<p>Expressed as a numeric score, the level of anticipated regret is equal to the level of action or inaction regret, if only one of the two subconstructs is assessed. When both the level of action and inaction regret are measured (with regard to the same target behaviour), the situation is different. In that case, people that experience anticipated regret tend to have a high score on either action or inaction regret. Therefore, calculating a sum or mean score for the two measures combined does not make sense, as this would make the scores of people with a strong experience of anticipated regret (e.g.&nbsp;4+0=4 sumscore) equal to people with a moderate experience of anticipated regret (e.g.&nbsp;2+2=4 sumscore), which would no do justice to their experience. Furthermore, it seems likely that for the former group, the instigation towards action/inaction with respect to the target behaviour is greater, precisely because in this group anticipated regret is experienced stronger. Creating a sum or average score from action and inaction regret scores thus does not make sense, neither to express the level of experienced anticipated regret nor to predict engagement vs non-engagement in the target behaviour.</p>
<p>Substracting one score from the other, or multiplying scores, does not help with the interpretation either. Therefore, no combined score is created from action and inaction regret and scores for both subcontructs are independently assessed and interpreted.</p>
For anticipated regret expressed as a composite score (i.e.&nbsp;the summation of action and inaction regret scores) see dct:anticip_regret_79n2w1bh

<p>Attitude consists of two sub-constructs, and is measured by measuring those, i.e.: dct:experientialAttitude_73dnt5z5 and dct:instrumentalAttitude_73dnt5zb</p>
A sample question to measure instrumental and experiental attitude would be (from Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2010, on p.&nbsp;450 of their book ‚ÄúPredicting and changing Behavior: The Reasoned Action Approach‚Äù): ‚ÄúMy exercising for at least 20 minutes, three times per week, for the next 3 months would be‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Answer options range from ‚Äúbad‚Äù to ‚Äúgood‚Äù (for instrumental attitude), and from ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù to ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù (for experiental attitude) on a 7-point Likert scale.

<p>Attitude towards noise is a specific subtype of attitude (see dct: attitude_73dnt5zc). It is assessed with instruments that consist of items that measure both the experiential (see dct:experientialAttitude_73dnt5z5) and instrumental (dct:instrumentalAttitude_73dnt5zb) attitude towards noise, as is for example the case for the ‚ÄòYouth Attitude to Noise Scale‚Äô (YANS) (Widen et al, 2006), or the instrument may measure attitude towards loud sounds without the items being particularly experiential or instrumental in nature.</p>
<p>When ‚Äúattitude towards noise‚Äù is assessed it is important that this attitude is measured in diverse situations, i.e.&nbsp;the situations must refer to both voluntarily and involuntarily chosen sources of loud noise (e.g.&nbsp;both pop concerts and traffic noise).</p>

<p>The first factor (phrased ‚Äúelements of youth culture‚Äù) of the ‚ÄòYouth Attitude to Noise Scale‚Äô (YANS) (Widen et al, 2006), consisting of 8 items, is an example of an instrument assessing this construct.

</td>
<td>
<p>Items to measure autonomy usually ask participants to consider the extent to which extent performance or nonperformance of the behaviour is under their control or is up to them. The focus here is on control over performance as well as nonperformance of the behaviour.</p>
<p>Fishbein &amp; Ajzen provide a sample question to measure autonomy on p.&nbsp;450 of their Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) book (2010): ‚ÄúMy exercising for at least 20 minutes, three times per week, for the next 3 months is up to me‚Äù. Answer options range from ‚ÄúDisagree‚Äù to ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù on a 7-point Likert scale.</p>
Other examples of items that measure autonomy are (p.&nbsp;166 of RAA book): ‚ÄúHow much control do you have over whether you perform behavior x?‚Äù (no control‚Äìcomplete control); ‚ÄúI feel in complete control over whether I perform behavior x‚Äù (completely false‚Äìcompletely true); ‚ÄúWhether or not I perform behavior x is completely up to me‚Äù (disagree‚Äìagree); ‚ÄúHow much do you feel that performing behavior x is beyond your control?‚Äù (not at all‚Äìvery much); ‚ÄúIt is mostly up to me whether or not I perform behavior x‚Äù (strongly agree‚Äìstrongly disagree); ‚ÄúThe number of events outside my control which could prevent me from performing behavior x are ‚Ä¶‚Äù (numerous‚Äìvery few).

This, preferably, is represented graphically (e.g.&nbsp;in a table or index) and, additionally, in an equation. See Table 5.5 on p.171 of the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) book (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2010) for an example.

</td>
<td>
<p>The measurement of autonomy beliefs starts with an elicitation study to identify the content of autonomy beliefs about the behaviour which are shared by the target population.</p>
<p>To obtain quantitative data regarding autonomy beliefs, the participant is subsequently asked to respond to two questions with respect to each autonomy belief, one to assess autonomy belief strength (see dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) and the other to measure the power of the autonomy belief to facilitate or impede behavioural performance (see dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs).</p>
Finally, to get an overall quantitative score of an autonomy belief, the strength of a belief is multiplied by its perceived power. The total score of an autonomy belief enables the assessment of the importance of the contribution of an autonomy belief, in comparison with other autonomy beliefs, to the autonomy beliefs composite (see dct:autonomy_belCom_73dnt5zw ).

<a href="../../repo/constructs/autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs.html">Perceived power of condition</a>
</td>
<td>
<p>The perceived power of a condition is measured by asking the extent to which a condition facilitates or impedes performance of a behavior. As the same condition can be facilitating for some people and impeding for others, this also implies that use of bidimensional scales is required. However, if one of the two dimensions can be excluded a priori, a unidimensional scale suffices.</p>
<p>For bidimensional scales, the items are formulated as ‚ÄòIf I want to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], (whether) [CONDITION] ‚Ä¶‚Äô with anchors ‚ÄòMuch harder‚Äô and ‚ÄòMuch easier‚Äô. For example, ‚ÄòIf I want to go for a run, rainy weather makes it [Much harder|Much easier].‚Äô</p>
<p>For unidimensional scales, which are only used if one of the dimensions can be excluded a priori, the way the items are formulated depends on whether they concern a barrier or a facilitator. For facilitators, use ‚ÄòIf I want to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], whether [CONDITION]‚Ä¶‚Äô with anchors ‚ÄòDoesn‚Äôt matter‚Äô and ‚ÄòMakes it much easier‚Äô, and for barriers, ‚ÄòIf I want to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], whether [CONDITION]‚Ä¶‚Äô with anchors ‚ÄòDoesn‚Äôt matter‚Äô and ‚ÄòMakes it much harder‚Äô.</p>
For example, ‚ÄòIf I want to use anticonception, whether it is widely available‚Ä¶‚Äô with anchors ‚ÄòDoesn‚Äôt matter‚Äô to ‚ÄòMakes it much easier‚Äô.

<p>Awareness, in the present definition, is the agreement between self-rated behaviour and a given behavioural guideline. The construct can be assessed in a three-step procedure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Firstly, participants are asked if their behaviour is in line with with the guidelines for that particular behaviour (yes/no). If the guideline is not known, in an introduction to the question this information is provided.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, participants‚Äô actual engagement in the target behaviour is assessed using objective measures (e.g.&nbsp;accelerometer and heart rate monitor to measure actual physical activity, caloric calculations to measure food intake).</p></li>
<li><p>Thirdly, the accuracy of participants‚Äô perception of their behaviour meeting the guidelines can be assessed by comparing the outcomes of step 1 and 2. As a result of this comparison, four awareness groups can be created: overestimators, underestimators, realistic (not meeting guideline), and realistic (meeting guideline). Thus, the latter two groups are aware of their behaviour, while the first two groups are not.</p></li>

<p>The prefered instruments to measure behaviour are observation by trained observers using a valid and reliable reporting protocol and/or the use of technical measures and devices to record and track behaviour during particular events and over time.</p>
<p>If these objective measures can not be used, self-report of behaviour assessed by questionniares or interviews are an alternative option. However, one should take into account that these latter instruments by definition measure a subjective representation of behaviour. Moreover, whereas there is general agreement about the definition of a specific behaviour (‚Äúrunning‚Äù), this is not the case when asking about a broad behavioural category, such as ‚Äúexercising‚Äù. To assess a category of behaviours via self-report, therefore, we must provide a clear definition of the category in question and specify action, target, context, and time.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the behaviour, engagement in the behaviour can be conceived as binary (i.e.&nbsp;one either does or does not engage in the target behaviour, e.g.&nbsp;getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter of frequency (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour with a frequency from zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g.&nbsp;the frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter of intensity (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour to a degree from zero up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g.&nbsp;the amount of kilocalories one consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g.&nbsp;how frequently one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).</p>
The instructions for developing a self-report instrument to measure behaviour, logically derive from the foregoing consideration regarding the nature of the behaviour of interest. For example, for a dichotomous response option (yes/no) the question can be formulated in the following way: ‚ÄúDid you get tested for STIs during the last six months?‚Äù. If the behaviour is a matter of frequency, multiple response options may be given, e.g.: ‚ÄúDuring the last seven days, how many days did you drink two or more alcoholic drinks?‚Äù, with response options ranging from 0 to 7.

<p>Behavioural scripts describe the sequencing of events involving observable, recurrent activities and patterns of interaction characteristic of a particular setting. As can be deduced from this definition, behavioral script can be observed. This measurement method is, however, very time intensive and unpractical.</p>
<p>The presence of behavioural scripts can also be assessed by self-report, using interviews and questionnaires as research methods. However, no specific questionnaires exist to measure the presence of behavioural scripts. Therefore, one could use a questionnaire to measure habitual behaviour, such as the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) (see dct:habit_79n2r0sz), and possibly apply some modifications to this measure, or develop a new questionnaire from scratch.</p>
A questionnaire measuring behavioural scripts for a particular behaviour can present different scenarios (each representing a particular behavioural script) and ask whether the participant performs the target behaviour in this fashion, with ‚ÄúVery likely‚Äù and ‚ÄúVery unlikely‚Äù at the extreme ends of a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. For example ‚ÄúWhen I am at a club or festival I usually get offered a couple of alcoholic drinks from friends, even when I don‚Äôt aks for them‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen I am at a club or festival and a stranger bumps into me, I don‚Äôt pay attention to it or start an argument, and I continue my way‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen I am at a club or festival I first walk around at the event to see who is there.‚Äù

<p>Skinner (2007) describes the state of assessment in the field of coping as ‚Äúchaotic and confusing‚Äù, and in a review (Skinner et al., 2003) identified over 100 assessments, tapping over 400 ways of coping.</p>
<p>Among the various measures, self-report instruments exist to assess coping styles among members of various groups (adults, children, adolescents, elderly), and scales may be broadly applicable, while others are ment for situation-specific application (e.g.&nbsp;health-related issues). The COPE (Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989) is the most frequently used instrument for broad application, and also one of the most commonly used measures in situation-specific contexts (Kato, 2015).</p>
<p>The 60-item COPE consists of 15 subscales (e.g.&nbsp;‚Äúactive coping‚Äù and ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù) and its theoretical development is based on the models of behavioral self-regulation (Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981) and stress and coping (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984). The COPE assumes that individual coping strategies are relatively stable across different types of stressors.</p>
<p>Individuals that participate in the COPE are asked to indicate on a 4-points scale what they usually do when they experience a stressful event (1 = I usually don‚Äôt do this at all, 2 = I usually do this a little bit, 3 = I usually do this a medium amount, 4 = I usually do this a lot). Examples of items used in the COPE are: ‚ÄúI get upset and let my emotions out‚Äù, ‚ÄúI laugh about the situation‚Äù, ‚ÄúI daydream about things other than this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think hard about what steps to take‚Äù.</p>
<p>The COPE, in its original form, measures coping style across different types of stressors. However, researchers have also adapted the scale to assess coping in specific situations (e.g.&nbsp;by replacing ‚Äústressful event‚Äù by a more narrow description of a potentially stressful situation), or by using only a selection of the 15 subscales. The COPE does not have an overall score, and the authors do not endorse combining subscales or deducing a dominant coping style from the scores (Carver, 2013).</p>
<p>Researchers that want to create their own coping scale (e.g.&nbsp;for specific groups, situations, or risk behaviours) can use the framework provided by Skinner et al.&nbsp;(2003), which identifies a dozen core families of coping based on action types. Any measure of coping, according to the authors, no matter the domain, developmental level, or time frame, should include ways of coping from each of these 12 families.</p>
<p>Different ways are used to classify coping styles into higher-order families. These classifications are often problematic (see Skinner et al., 2003 for a thorough discussion). Engagement and disengagement coping (see dct:engCoping and dct:disengCoping) is the higher-order structure adhered by Carver (2019), and the one used here. One should, however, take into account that the presence or absence of particular coping styles should be assessed at a higher level of specificity, e.g.&nbsp;coping styles pertaining to the 12 families identified by Skinner et al.&nbsp;(2003) or the 15 subscales of the COPE (Carver, 2013) should be selected. After an assessment is made at this higher level of specificity, subsequently one can potentially classify an individual‚Äôs dominant overall coping style as engagement (see dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengagement coping (see dct:disengCoping_79n2w1bk). Which particular coping styles researchers should direct their focus on, will depend on their appropriateness for the target event and age group (Skinner, 2007).</p>

<p>Disengagement coping may be conceived at the highest level of a hierarchical factor structure with three levels (Tobin et al., 1989), with one level below, ‚Äúproblem disengagement‚Äù and ‚Äúemotion disengagement‚Äù, and at the lowest level, respectively, ‚Äúproblem avoidance‚Äù and ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù (for problem disengagement), and ‚Äúself criticism‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial withdrawal‚Äù (for emotion disengagement).

<p>Emotions affect an individual on different levels (behaviour, physiology, affect, cognition). As a consequence, multiple measurement methods may be employed, and possibly integrated, to measure emotion. Self-report, other-report, observation, and neurophysiology are the measurement methods most dominantly used in emotion research.</p>
<p>A three-step system for choosing a measure of emotion can be employed (Ekkekakis, 2008): 1) Decide whether you wish to study core affect, emotion, or mood (these are related but different constructs); 2) Choose the most appropriate theoretical framework for the chosen construct; 3) Select the psychometrically strongest measure based on the chosen theoretical framework.</p>
<p>In the context of behaviour change, emotions may exert an influence on the target behaviour in various ways. The mere thought of performing the behaviour may trigger a strong emotion and in- or decrease the likelihood of performing the behaviour. Emotions may also affect the actual performance of the behaviour. The kinds of emotion that are experienced before, during, and after the behaviour may also be diverse (e.g.&nbsp;anger, shame, or joy).</p>
The foregoing must be taken into account when a measurement instrument is chosen or developed, e.g.&nbsp;if a (fictitious) research hypothesis is that the experience of ‚Äúpositive‚Äù emotions (e.g.&nbsp;joy, pride) and ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotions (e.g.&nbsp;anger, shame), respectively, de- and increase the number of cigarettes smoked during a day, then retrospective assessment of experienced emotions with a self-report questionnaire likely is not the most appropriate instrument, but an measurement method that is able to record emotions at various moments of the day such as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) is a better candidate.

</td>

<p>Experiential attitude belief expectations are measured using questions in a questionnaire that are referred to as ‚Äòitems‚Äô. To measure an experiential attitude belief expectation, first, identify exactly which potential experiential consequence of the target behavior (e.g.&nbsp;a specific experience or sensation) you want to measure. Then, establish whether accurately describing the spectrum of possibilities regarding this experiential consequence requires a unidimensional scale or a bidimensional scale. Most potential consequences of a target behavior can be perceived either to <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em> upon performance of the target behavior, requiring a bidimensional scale. For example, some people might expect they will feel <em>less</em> relaxed if they drink alcohol, while others might expect they will feel <em>more</em> relaxed. However, in rare cases, one of the two dimensions can be excluded a priori, in which case a unidimensional scale suffices. For example, the degree to which people will expect they will feel less hungry may vary; but it is excessively unlikely that somebody might expect that if they eat a whole pizza, they will then feel <em>more</em> hungry. Therefore, in that case, one might want to choose a unidimensional scale. In general, a rule of thumb is that if the ‚Äòdefault state‚Äô of this experiential consequence resembles absence of the experience, and therefore, engaging in the target behavior can only have an effect in one direction, a unidimensional scale can be used. However, when engaging in the target behavior can conceivably increase <em>or</em> decrease this experiential consequence, a bidimensional scale is required.</p>
<p>Once it is clear whether a bidimensional or unidimensional scale should be used, the construction of the item stem and the two anchors can start. Make sure to formulate the item stem such that it makes clear that you are asking people about <em>their</em> expectation (not what they think holds more generally).</p>
<p>For unidimensional scales, create an item stem that explicitly lists the single dimension that expresses the experiential consequence (e.g.&nbsp;feeling full after eating a pizza). As anchors, always use ‚ÄòVery unlikely‚Äô and ‚ÄòVery likely‚Äô. An example item would be: ‚ÄòIf I eat a whole pizza at once, it is ‚Ä¶ that it will make me feel full. [Very unlikely|Very likely]‚Äô. However, as explained above, unidimensional scales can rarely be used in most circumstances, so bidimensional scales are usually required.</p>
<p>For bidimensional scales, the item stem cannot explicitly list only one of the two dimensions (e.g.&nbsp;‚Äòfeeling much less relaxed‚Äô or ‚Äòfeeling much more relaxed‚Äô). This is because this would create a unidimensional or ambiguous response scale. People who would score low on the unidimensional scale might mean either that they don‚Äôt think that consequence will occur, or that they think that the opposite consequence will occur. For example, when creating an item ‚ÄòIf I drink a glass of alcohol, I will feel much more relaxed. [Very unlikely|Very likely]‚Äô, people who respond ‚ÄòVery unlikely‚Äô can mean either that they expect to feel much less relaxed, or that they expect that drinking a glass of alcohol will have no effect on how relaxed they will feel.</p>
<p>Therefore, capturing the full potential breadth of the beliefs of your target population requires asking what they expect exactly. To do this, create an item stem that contains the target behavior, and anchors that express the extremes of the bidimensional scale. For example, ‚ÄòDrinking alcohol makes me feel ‚Ä¶ [much less relaxed|much more relaxed]‚Äô. Sometimes, the two extremes of the dimension you want to measure can be expressed in two antonyms, such as ‚ÄòDrinking alcohol makes me feel ‚Ä¶ [much more relaxed|much more excited]‚Äô.</p>
<p>Once the item stem and the two anchors have been determined, decide which response scale to use. For bidimensional scales, seven-point scales are preferred, as these leave three degrees of expression in each dimension (the mid-point representing the expectation that the behavior does not have a consequence regarding this specific experiential attitude belief). For unidimensional scales, five-point scales suffice. Try to always be consistent in the scale valence; in languages that are read from left to right, always place the most passive/low/less/weak/unlikely scale extreme (anchor) on the left, and the most active/high/more/strong/likely scale extreme (anchor) on the right. Do not reverse this order for one or more items.</p>
<p>When combining multiple items in one measurement instrument, if both evaluations of unidimensional consequences and evaluations of bidimensional consequences are measured, either use two matrices or combine them in one that uses seven-point scales for all items.</p>
The item or set of items should be accompanied by an instruction that makes clear that you are asking people about <em>their</em> expectation (not what they think holds more generally).

<p>The 12-item SRHI (Verplanken &amp; Orbell, 2003) is the instrument most frequently used to measure habit (Gardner, 2015). The SRHI is supposed to measure behaviour performed across contexts. However, specific context cues can be added by modifying the stem of SRHI-items.</p>
<p>All 12 SRHI-items start with the sentence ‚ÄúTARGET BEHAVIOUR is something‚Ä¶‚Äù, after which a particular statement follows for each individual item, such as ‚ÄúI do frequently‚Äù, ‚ÄúI do automatically‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThat would require effort not to do‚Äù. The items are accompanied by response scales anchored by agree/disagree and contain five or more response categories.</p>
<p>An example of an item measuring ‚Äúsmoking cigarettes‚Äù (the target behaviour) as habit, thus, would be: ‚ÄúSmoking cigarettes is something I do automatically‚Äù.</p>
A critique on self-report measures of habit, such as the SRHI, is that they require respondents to reflect on behaviours that are automatic and, as such, outside of conscious awareness (Van Bree, 2018).

<p>The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) (Guay et al., 2000) is a frequently used self-report instrument to assess identified regulation of behaviour. Beside identified regulation of behaviour, the SIMS assesses intrinsic regulation, external regulation, and amotivation, and is used to assess motivation for various activities (e.g.&nbsp;physical exercise, academic performance).</p>
<p>The SIMS asks participants ‚ÄúWhy are you currently engaged in this activity?‚Äù. Scale items represent potential answers to this question. Responses are given on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from ‚ÄúDoes not correspond at all‚Äù to ‚ÄúCorresponds exactly‚Äù.</p>

<p>To measure impulsive action in humans, several tests exist in which participants have to carry out an assignment or a series of assignments; among these tests the go-no go task, stop signal task (SST), Stroop task, and the continuous performance task (CPT) are most often utilized.</p>
<p>In addition, self-report instruments are used to measure impulsive choice and/or impulsive action, of which the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is most commonly used. The BIS-11 consists of 30 items, and answers on each item are measured on a 4-point scale (rarely/never, occasionally, often, almost always), with higher scores indicative of greater impulsivity. Examples of items used are: ‚ÄúI act on the spur of the moment‚Äù and ‚Äù I say things without thinking‚Äù.</p>
<p>The aforementioned tests measure impulsive action as a general trait, not related to specific behaviours or objects. If one wants to assess impulsivity with regard to a particular behaviour or object, specific questions can be composed that measure the frequency impulses are experienced, and/or the strength of these impulses, in situations related to the target behaviour/object.</p>
<p>To measure impulsivity related to a specific behaviour, the stem ‚ÄúWhen it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR‚Ä¶.‚Äù can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of impulsivity. For example: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to smoking cigarettes‚Ä¶ 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don‚Äôt manage to plan my behaviour 4) I act on the spur of the moment 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from‚Äùtotally agree‚Äù to ‚Äútotally disagree‚Äù.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a series of unique items can be composed to measure behaviour- or object-related impulsivity, such as: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wear ear plugs because when I decide to go to an event or concert it‚Äôs on the spur of the moment‚Äù (for target behaviour ‚Äúwearing ear plugs when exposed to loud music‚Äù) and ‚ÄúWhen I hear a good track, I just have to turn off the volume restriction‚Äù (for target behaviour ‚Äúuse volume restriction on music players‚Äù) with responses ‚Äútotally agree‚Äù and ‚Äútotally disagree‚Äù as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale.</p>
Impulsivity can be regarded as the converse of self-control. Therefore, the same instrument to assess self control (dct:self_control_79n2fh4t) can potentially be used to measure impulsivity. However, the scoring for the questionnaire items should be reversed (see dct:self_control_79n2fh4t for an example).

</td>

<p>Instrumental attitude belief expectations are measured using questions in a questionnaire that are referred to as ‚Äòitems‚Äô. To measure an instrumental attitude belief expectation, first, identify exactly which potential instrumental consequence of the target behavior (e.g.&nbsp;a specific benefit or advantage) you want to measure. Then, establish whether accurately describing the spectrum of possibilities regarding this instrumental consequence requires a unidimensional scale or a bidimensional scale. Most potential consequences of a target behavior can be perceived either to <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em> upon performance of the target behavior, requiring a bidimensional scale. For example, some people might expect that drinking four cups of coffee every day contributes to their goal of being healthy, whether others might expect that that is unhealthy instead, expecting that not consuming any coffee at all is more healthy. However, in rare cases, one of the two dimensions can be excluded a priori, in which case a unidimensional scale suffices. For example, the degree to which people will expect that exercising regularly for a month will increase their health may vary; but is it excessively unlikely that somebody might expect that if they exercise regularly for a month, their health will <em>decrease</em>. Therefore, in that case, one might want to choose a unidimensional scale. In general, a rule of thumb is that if the ‚Äòdefault state‚Äô of this instrumental consequence resembles absence of the potential consequence, and therefore, engaging in the target behavior can only have an effect in one direction, a unidimensional scale can be used. However, when engaging in the target behavior can conceivably increase <em>or</em> decrease this instrumental consequence, a bidimensional scale is required.</p>
<p>Once it is clear whether a bidimensional or unidimensional scale should be used, the construction of the item stem and the two anchors can start. Make sure to formulate the item stem such that it makes clear that you are asking people about <em>their</em> expectation (not what they think holds more generally).</p>
<p>For unidimensional scales, create an item stem that explicitly lists the single dimension that expresses the instrumental consequence (e.g.&nbsp;exercising regularly for a month leading to increased health). As anchors, always use ‚ÄòVery unlikely‚Äô and ‚ÄòVery likely‚Äô. An example item would be: ‚ÄòIf I exercise regularly for a month, it is ‚Ä¶ that my health will increase. [Very unlikely|Very likely]‚Äô. However, as explained above, unidimensional scales can rarely be used in most circumstances, so bidimensional scales are usually required.</p>
<p>For bidimensional scales, the item stem cannot explicitly list only one of the two dimensions (e.g.&nbsp;‚Äòbecome much less healthy‚Äô or ‚Äòbecome much more healthy‚Äô). This is because this would create a unidimensional or ambiguous response scale. People who would score low on the unidimensional scale might mean either that they don‚Äôt think that consequence will occur, or that they think that the opposite consequence will occur. For example, when creating an item ‚ÄòIf I drink four cups of coffee every day, I will become much more healthy. [Very unlikely|Very likely]‚Äô, people who respond ‚ÄòVery unlikely‚Äô can mean either that they expect to feel much less healthy, or that they expect that drinking four cups of coffee every day will have no effect on their health.</p>
<p>Therefore, capturing the full potential breadth of the beliefs of your target population requires asking what they expect exactly. To do this, create an item stem that contains the target behavior, and anchors that express the extremes of the bidimensional scale. For example, ‚ÄòDrinking four cups of coffee every day leads to me being ‚Ä¶ [much less healthy|much more healthy]‚Äô. Sometimes, the two extremes of the dimension you want to measure can be expressed in two antonyms, such as ‚ÄòDrinking four cups of coffee makes me ‚Ä¶ [very idle|very productive]‚Äô.</p>
<p>Once the item stem and the two anchors have been determined, decide which response scale to use. For bidimensional scales, seven-point scales are preferred, as these leave three degrees of expression in each dimension (the mid-point representing the expectation that the behavior does not have a consequence regarding this specific instrumental attitude belief). For unidimensional scales, five-point scales suffice. Try to always be consistent in the scale valence; in languages that are read from left to right, always place the most passive/low/less/weak/unlikely scale extreme (anchor) on the left, and the most active/high/more/strong/likely scale extreme (anchor) on the right. Do not reverse this order for one or more items.</p>
<p>When combining multiple items in one measurement instrument, if both evaluations of unidimensional consequences and evaluations of bidimensional consequences are measured, either use two matrices or combine them in one that uses seven-point scales for all items.</p>
The item or set of items should be accompanied by an instruction that makes clear that you are asking people about <em>their</em> expectation (not what they think holds more generally).

<p>Instruments that measure need satisfaction most often assume that humans have universal needs. In particular, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) and Maslow‚Äôs (1968) Hierarchy of Needs have instigated the development of instruments to measure the satisfaction of these universal needs. The Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) (Gagn√© et al., 2003) and the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (BMPN) (Sheldon et al., 2012) measure needs from a SDT-perspective, while the Basic Need Satisfaction Inventory (BNSI) (Leidy et al., 1994)) adopts Maslow‚Äôs standpoint on human needs.</p>
<p>For behaviour change (e.g.&nbsp;instigating healthy lifestyle choices), measuring general, as well as measuring domain- or activity-specific need satisfaction may have its merits. For example, Timmerman et al.&nbsp;(2001) found that the lower the level of basic need satisfaction, the more likely one is engaged in emotional eating. Need satisfaction at this general level, however, is harder to change than needs being met by specific activities or in a narrow domain. Therefore, instruments pertaining to the latter category are preferably used.</p>
<p>Need satisfaction can be asssessed by following a series of four steps: Firstly, depending on the theoretical background one adheres to (e.g.&nbsp;SDT) a list of of universal needs is composed. Secondly, to measure whether these needs are met by the situation or activity of interest, for each of these needs a number of items are used to assess the level of needs satisfaction. Thirdly, the item sumscores for each need, and the overall sumcore of all needs together are calculated. Fourth, the degree individual needs and all need together are satisfied by an activity or situation can be deduced from the two sumscores.</p>
<p>Need satisfaction in a particular domain can, for example, be assessed with the following sample items. These sample items pertain to the assessment of need satisfaction at work but (with slight adjustments) could also be used to measure need satisfaction in other domains or concerning specific activities. Participants are asked to indicate how true each statement is for them, with answer option ranging from ‚ÄúNot at all true‚Äù to ‚ÄúVery true‚Äù on a 7-point Likert scale: ‚ÄúI feel like I can make a lot of inputs to deciding how my job gets done‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeople at work care about me‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMost days I feel a sense of accomplishment from working‚Äù. These three items reflect what SDT regards as the three basic human needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence.</p>

<p>Numerous instruments exist that aim to measure human personality. Most instruments are self-report questionnaires. However, other measures of personality exist such as performance tests, instruments for direct observation, semi-structured interviews, and projective tests.</p>
<p>The choice for a particular instrument is largely driven by the specific personality theory one adheres to; for example the influential Big Five model of personality traits, or five-factor model (FFM), has inspired the creation of a number of self-report instruments (such as the the Revised NEO Personality Inventory [NEO PI-R]) that assess the relative presence of each of the Big Five personality traits (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) in a person.</p>
The NEO PI-R consists of 240 items such as ‚ÄúI like to have a lot of people around me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI often find myself in disagreements with my family and colleagues‚Äù. Answers are given on a 5-points Likert scale ranging from ‚ÄúTotally disagree‚Äù to ‚ÄúTotally agree‚Äù. Each of the five personality dimensions in the NEO PI-R consists of six facets. At the broadest level, personality can be described in terms of five basic dimensions by summing the six facets in each domain. More precise estimates of standing on the five factors, can be provided by factor scores (i.e.&nbsp;a weighted combination of scores on all 30 facets). For interpretation, an individual‚Äôs scores on the NEO PI-R are compared to a relevant reference group (e.g.&nbsp;adult men).

These questionnaires reflect one specific perspective on PH. In line with our DCT definition for PH, we intend to combine a number of these questionnaires into one instrument. For this we need to investigate which items predict best if someone is afflicted by PH. This study is now (January 2023) underway. Previous validation research for PH did not involve Item Response Theory techniques. We make use of IRT to make the best selection of cue valid items from the different measurement instruments for PH. These items and instruments have been developed within the three perspectives on PH (sex addiction, hypersexual disorder, compulsive sexual behavior disorder). IRT might help to decide on what characteristics best define PH.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamical assessment - As specified in the definition, we see PH as driven by high sexual desire in combination with emotion dysregulation. These dynamical and fluctuating processes involved in PH we see as underlying the more permanent outcomes (each of the ten characteristics of PH). Experience Sampling Method (ESM) techniques are most optimal to assess these processes, as ESM is an ecologically valid method that is capable to assess fluctuations in sexual desire and emotions and link these to sexual activity in temporal analyses. Currently, a number of items are involved in measuring sexual desire and emotions with ESM techniques. Response Process Evaluations (Wolf et al., 2019) of these items needs to be undertaken still.</p>

In addition, analyzing the interaction between prototype favourability and similarity can increase predictive validity (Van Lettow et al., 2016). For example, in the study by Rivis et al.&nbsp;(2011) more favourable perceptions of the drink-driver prototype were associated with greater willingness to drink and drive at high (but not moderate or low) levels of prototype similarity.

<p>In a meta-analysis of self-control measures, Duckwort et al.&nbsp;(2011) distinguised four distinct approaches to the measurement of self-control: executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, selfreport questionnaires, and informant-report questionnaires.</p>
<p>Among the self- and informant-report questionnaires, over 100 unique instruments were discerned (Duckwort et al., 2011). Items on these questionnaires suggest considerable heterogeneity in the underlying constructs assessed. However, Duckwort et al.&nbsp;(2011) found that urgency (the inability to override strong impulses, e.g., ‚ÄúI have trouble controlling my impulses‚Äù), (lack of) premeditation (acting before thinking , e.g., ‚ÄúMy thinking is usually careful and purposeful‚Äù ), and (lack of) perseverance (the inability to focus on boring or difficult tasks, e.g., ‚ÄúI tend to give up easily‚Äù) are three central and related features of self-control. Therefore, when self-constructing an instrument to assess self-control, these three facets of self-control should be included. Moreover, for behaviour change, self-control related to a specific behaviour or object is of greater interest than self-control as a trait (i.e.&nbsp;stable across time and situations). Therefore, in a behaviour change setting, questionnaire items should refer to the specific behaviour or object of interest.</p>
<p>Impulsivity can be regarded as the converse of self-control. Questionnaire items that attempt to measure self-control often present mutually exclusive responses. One response is aligned with long-term goals and standards, while the alternative response is more gratifying or automatic in the short-term. Self-controlled individuals tend to choose the first response, whereas impulsive individuals tend to choose the latter response.</p>
If impulsivity is regarded as the converse of self-control, the same instrument used to assess impulsivity (see dct:impulse_79n2r0t0) can potentially also be used to measure self-control. However, the scoring for each questionnaire item should be reversed, i.e.&nbsp;if a high score on an item indicates a high level of impulsivity, it indicates a low level of self-control. For example: ‚ÄúWhen it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR I act on the spur of the moment‚Äù with responses ranging from ‚ÄúTotally agree‚Äù (=5) to ‚ÄúTotally disagree‚Äù (=1) on a 5-point Likert scale. A high score (=5) here is indicative of a high level of impulsivity and a low level of self-control.

<p>As a so-called ‚Äúdirect measure‚Äù, the items recommended by Snippe et al.&nbsp;(2020, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ygpmw) can be used.</p>
<p>According to the definition of self-identity in this DCT, if a target behavior is strongly associated to somebody‚Äôs self-identity, to the degree that this is not only a reflection of the frequency or intensity with which they engage in that behavior, this association reflects the fact that one or more attributes is simultaneously connected to the target behavior and central to one‚Äôs self-identity.</p>
Therefore, to map the construct content for a given target behavior, for each attribute dimension along which self-identification can occur, two things have to be measured. First, that attribute‚Äôs centrality: the degree to which people consider that attribute a part of their self-identity. Second, the strength of that attribute‚Äôs association to the target behavior.

<li><p>An individual‚Äôs self-reported self-monitoring behaviour can be measured with a questionnnaire or interview. Questionnnaire items to measure self-monitoring with respect to the target behaviour can, for example, be formulated in the following way: ‚ÄúBy counting the number of alcoholic drinks, I know exactly how much alcohol I consume during a night clubbing‚Äù or ‚ÄúI use a diary or mobile app to track my daily food consumption‚Äù. Response can be either dichotomous (yes/no) or three response options can be provided (‚ÄúDoes not apply‚Äù, ‚ÄúMore or less‚Äù, ‚ÄúDoes apply‚Äù).

<li><p>What kind of person would you like to be? Assign a score from 1 to 6 to each of the following six descriptions. Each score is assigned once (i.e.&nbsp;a score of 6 for the description you would most want to be like, and a score of 1 for the description you would least want to be like). [Six descriptions or traits are given - the choice and length of the descriptions is determined by the target behaviour and target population in question. For example: Assertive, Brilliant, Eloquent, Unpredictable, Athletic, and Resourceful.]</p></li>
<li><p>‚ÄúDo you think a person that [include one of the six previous descriptions] would engage in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?‚Äù For each of the six descriptions the response options are: ‚ÄúVery likely‚Äù(=2), ‚ÄúLikely‚Äù (=1), ‚ÄúNot Likely or Unlikely‚Äù (=0), ‚ÄúUnlikely‚Äù (-1), ‚ÄúVery unlikely‚Äù (-2).</p></li>

<p>The answers to question 1 and 2 are multiplied. This results in a maximum score of 42 and a minimum score of -42.</p>

Participants responded on a scale ranging from ‚ÄúVery unwilling‚Äù (=1) to ‚ÄúVery willing‚Äù (=7).</p>
Davies et al.&nbsp;(2017) expressed that a pilot study revealed that use of the verb ‚Äúwilling to‚Äù was difficult to understand for young adults. Therefore, (young) participants were asked to indicate the ‚Äúlikelihood‚Äù they would engage in a behaviour. Ideally thus the phrasing of items using ‚Äúwilling to‚Äù (or similar) should be first tested among the target population in a pilot study.
