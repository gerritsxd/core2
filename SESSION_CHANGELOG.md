# Session Changelog: Implementing Scalable Construct Search

This document details the significant changes made to the Quarto Construct Repository project during our collaborative session. The primary goal was to implement a scalable and efficient search feature on the construct overview page that searches only construct titles without loading all construct data at once, improving user experience without relying on external services.

## Key Files Modified/Created

1.  `generate_construct_pages.py` (Python Script)
2.  `repo/overview/index.qmd` (Quarto Markdown - Search Page)
3.  `_quarto.yml` (Quarto Project Configuration)
4.  `requirements.txt` (Python Dependencies)
5.  `repo/_metadata.yml` (Quarto Directory-Specific Metadata)
6.  `repo/index.qmd` (Quarto Markdown - Main Repository Page)

## Detailed Changes Per File

### 1. `generate_construct_pages.py`

*   **Initial State**: This script was primarily responsible for generating individual `.qmd` pages for each construct from YAML data files.
*   **Modifications**:
    *   **Search Index Generation**: Enhanced to create a `search_index.json` file. This JSON contains a minimal list of objects, each with `title`, `subtitle` (UCID), and `url` for a construct. This was done to provide a lightweight index for client-side searching.
    *   **Robust Pathing for Script Execution**: Modified to use absolute paths derived from its own file location (`os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))`). This fixed a critical bug where `search_index.json` was not being created when the script was run as a Quarto `pre-render` step, as the working directory was different.
    *   **Absolute URLs in Search Index**: Changed the `url` field in `search_index.json` entries from relative (`../constructs/...`) to absolute (`/repo/constructs/...`). This resolved 404 errors when clicking search results, ensuring links worked correctly from the overview page.
    *   **YAML Data Handling**: Made the `create_section` helper function more robust. It now checks if the input data for sections like 'definition' is a dictionary or a simple string and processes it accordingly. This fixed an `AttributeError` that occurred when some YAML files had simpler structures than others.
    *   **Encoding**: Ensured files were opened and written with `utf-8` encoding.
    *   **JSON Formatting**: Added `indent=2` to `json.dump` for better readability of `search_index.json`.

### 2. `repo/overview/index.qmd`

*   **Initial State**: This page previously used a Quarto listing feature or directly listed constructs, which was not scalable for a large number of items.
*   **Modifications**:
    *   **Custom Search Interface**: The entire content was replaced with a new HTML structure to implement a custom search bar and a results display area.
    *   **Client-Side Search Logic (JavaScript)**: Added a significant JavaScript block to:
        *   Asynchronously `fetch` the `search_index.json` file when the page loads.
        *   Handle potential errors during fetching (e.g., if `search_index.json` is not found, display an error message).
        *   Listen for `input` events on the search bar.
        *   Filter the loaded construct index based on the user's search term (case-insensitive title matching).
        *   Dynamically generate and display the list of matching constructs as clickable links in the results area.

### 3. `_quarto.yml` (Main Project Configuration)

*   **Initial State**: Standard Quarto project configuration.
*   **Modifications**:
    *   **Pre-render Script Execution**: Added (and later re-confirmed/fixed) the `pre-render: generate_construct_pages.py` line under the `project` section. This was crucial for ensuring the Python script runs automatically before Quarto builds the site, generating the construct pages and the search index.
    *   **Resource Management (Critical Fix for 404s)**:
        *   Added `repo/overview/search_index.json` to the `resources` list to ensure Quarto copies the generated search index to the final `public` output directory.
        *   Added `css/*.*` and `js/*.*` to the `resources` list. This was a major fix to resolve site-wide 404 errors for stylesheets and JavaScript files, as these directories were not being copied to the `public` folder.
    *   **Global Stylesheet Path**: Changed `format: html: css: styles.css` to `css: /styles.css` (an absolute path). This fixed issues where pages in subdirectories could not find the main stylesheet.

### 4. `requirements.txt`

*   **Initial State**: This file was missing or had been deleted at some point during the project's lifecycle.
*   **Modifications**:
    *   **Re-created**: The file was created anew.
    *   **Added Dependency**: `PyYAML==6.0.1` was added. This fixed a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` when `generate_construct_pages.py` was executed, as PyYAML is required for parsing the construct data files.

### 5. `repo/_metadata.yml` (Directory-Specific Configuration)

*   **Initial State**: This file included various CSS and JS files for pages within the `repo/` directory using relative paths.
*   **Modifications**:
    *   **Absolute Asset Paths (Critical Fix for 404s)**: All asset paths in the `include-in-header` section (e.g., for `psycore.css`, `sortable.min.css`, `marked.min.js`, `prepDCTtxt.js`) were changed from relative (`../css/...`, `../js/...`) to absolute (`/css/...`, `/js/...`). This resolved numerous 404 errors for these assets when viewing pages within the `repo/` subdirectory.
    *   **Stylesheet Path**: The local `css: styles.css` was changed to `css: /styles.css` to use an absolute path, consistent with global changes.
    *   **HTML Syntax Correction**: A minor HTML error (a `</script>` tag incorrectly placed on a `<link>` tag) was corrected.

### 6. `repo/index.qmd` (Main Repository Landing Page)

*   **Initial State**: Contained a link to the construct overview page.
*   **Modifications**:
    *   **Link Path Correction**: The link `[Overview of all constructs](overview/index.html)` was changed to `[Overview of all constructs](/repo/overview/)`. This change to an absolute path resolved navigation issues and problems with asset loading on the target overview page when accessed from `repo/index.qmd`.

## Problem-Solving Journey Summary

The session involved several iterative debugging cycles:

1.  **Initial 404 for `search_index.json`**: Diagnosed that the file wasn't being copied to the `public` directory. This led to adding it to `_quarto.yml` resources.
2.  **`search_index.json` Still Not Found**: Further investigation revealed the Python script wasn't creating the file in the *source* directory due to incorrect relative paths when run by Quarto. Fixed by using absolute paths in the script.
3.  **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`**: The Python script failed because `PyYAML` was not installed. Fixed by re-creating `requirements.txt` and installing dependencies.
4.  **Python Script `AttributeError`**: The script crashed on certain YAML files. Fixed by making the data parsing logic in `create_section` more robust.
5.  **Missing `pre-render` Command**: Realized the `pre-render` line in `_quarto.yml` was missing, preventing the Python script from running at all. Restored this line.
6.  **404s on Individual Construct Pages (Links from Search)**: Search results linked to non-existent pages. Fixed by changing URL generation in `search_index.json` to use absolute paths (`/repo/constructs/...`).
7.  **Widespread 404s for CSS/JS Assets**: Pages in subdirectories (like `/repo/overview/` and `/repo/`) couldn't load their assets. This was the most systemic issue.
    *   Fixed by changing asset paths in `repo/_metadata.yml` to be absolute.
    *   Fixed by adding `css/*.*` and `js/*.*` to `resources` in `_quarto.yml`.
    *   Fixed by changing the main `styles.css` path in `_quarto.yml` to be absolute.
8.  **Broken Navigation from `repo/index.qmd`**: The link to the overview page was relative and caused issues. Fixed by making the link absolute.

Through these steps, we successfully implemented the desired search functionality and resolved underlying configuration and pathing issues to ensure the website builds correctly and is fully navigable.
