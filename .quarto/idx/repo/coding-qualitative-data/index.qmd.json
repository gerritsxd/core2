For example, indicating that a person wearing ear plugs when in a club is \"cool/uncool\" and not saying that this particular person is \"smart/dumb\", may indicate that \"coolness\" is an important factor (and likely more important than \"smartness\") to assess the level of favourability with regard to the prototype. \n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of similarity, containing verbs such as \"familiar/unfamiliar\",  \"related/unrelated\", \"resemble/differ\" should be coded as dct:prototypeSimilarity_79n2fh4t.\n\nExpressions that exhibit the presence of a prototype image associated with the behaviour without a reference to favourability or similarity should be coded as dct:prototype_79n2fh4t.\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href='/repo/constructs/prototypeSimilarity_79n2fh4t.html'>Prototype similarity</a></td><td>Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of similarity, containing verbs such as \"familiar/unfamiliar\",  \"related/unrelated\", and \"resemble/differ\". \n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of favourability, containing verbs such as \"smart/dumb\", \"attractive/unattractive\", and \"desirable/undiserable\" should be coded as dct:prototypeFavourability_79n2fh4t.\n\nExpressions that exhibit the presence of a prototype image associated with the behaviour without a reference to favourability or similarity should be coded as dct:prototype_79n2fh4t.\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><a href='/repo/constructs/prototype_79n2fh4t.html'>Prototype</a></td><td>Expressions that exhibit the presence of a prototype image associated with the performance of a behaviour (or abstaining from it) without a reference to favourability or similarity.
