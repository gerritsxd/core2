For example, participants are asked to indicate if they are temped to take drugs in the following situations: \"When I am feeling depressed\", \"When I am being offered drugs in a social situation\", \"When I am physically tired\", \"When I see others using drugs at a bar or a party\" with responses \"Not at all\", \"Not very\", \"Moderately\", \"Very\", and \"Extremely\" for each item on a 5-point Likert scale. The sample items are from the Temptation to Use Drugs Scale (Di Clemente et al., 1994).\n\nAnother example is provided by Lazuras et al. (2010). They measured the situational tempation among athletes to use doping substances with the stem proposition “How much would you be tempted to use prohibited doping substances to enhance your performance this season,” followed by four items reflecting temptations to use prohibited performance-enhancing substances under different circumstances that potentially induce normative influence (“when your coach suggests so,” “when you believe that most colleagues of yours use prohibited substances,” “when you were told to enhance your performance,” and “when you prepare for an important game/competition”). Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all tempted, 5 = very much tempted).\n\nNote that the instructions and examples given above apply to the measurement of situational temptation. For the measurement of the susceptibility to tempations in general (i.e. assessing the presence of a personality trait as the causal factor) other instructions and instruments apply, e.g. the Susceptibility to Temptation Scale can be used.\n\n## Coding Measurement Instruments\n\nQuestions or questionnaires that measure the degree to which participants are temped by a situation or stimulus to carry out the behaviour of interest.
