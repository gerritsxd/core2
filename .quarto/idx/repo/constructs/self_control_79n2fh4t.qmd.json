(2011) distinguised four distinct approaches to the measurement of self-control: executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, selfreport questionnaires, and informant-report questionnaires. \n\nAmong the self- and informant-report questionnaires, over 100 unique instruments were  discerned (Duckwort et al., 2011). Items on these questionnaires suggest considerable heterogeneity in the underlying constructs assessed. However, Duckwort et al. (2011) found that urgency (the inability to override strong impulses, e.g., “I have trouble controlling my impulses”), (lack of) premeditation (acting before thinking , e.g., “My thinking is usually careful and purposeful” ), and (lack of) perseverance (the inability to focus on boring or difficult tasks, e.g., “I tend to give up easily”) are three central and related features of self-control. Therefore, when self-constructing an instrument to assess self-control, these three facets of self-control should be included. Moreover, for behaviour change, self-control related to a specific behaviour or object is of greater interest than self-control as a trait (i.e. stable across time and situations). Therefore, in a behaviour change setting, questionnaire items should refer to the specific behaviour or object of interest.  \n\nImpulsivity can be regarded as the converse of self-control. Questionnaire items that attempt to measure self-control often present mutually exclusive responses. One response is aligned with long-term goals and standards, while the alternative response is more gratifying or automatic in the short-term. Self-controlled individuals tend to choose the first response, whereas impulsive individuals tend to choose the latter response.\n\nIf impulsivity is regarded as the converse of self-control, the same instrument used to assess impulsivity (see dct:impulse_79n2r0t0) can potentially also be used to measure self-control. However, the scoring for each questionnaire item should be reversed, i.e. if a high score on an item indicates a high level of impulsivity, it indicates a low level of self-control. For example: \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR I act on the spur of the moment\" with responses ranging from \"Totally agree\" (=5) to \"Totally disagree\" (=1) on a 5-point Likert scale. A high score (=5) here is indicative of a high level of impulsivity and a low level of self-control.\n\n\n## Coding Measurement Instruments\n\nQuestions or questionnaires that measure self-control related to a specific behaviour or object. For self-report asessment, a statement such as \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR....\" can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of self-control. For example: \"When it comes to smoking cigarettes... 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don't manage to plan my behaviour; 4) I act on the spur of the moment; 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions; 6) I afterwards frequently regret that I smoked. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"totally agree\" to \"totally disagree\".\n\nBeside behaviour- or object-related self-control, self-control as a trait can be measured. In fact, most self-control instruments measure self-control as a trait (i.e. stable across time and situations). Furthermore, beside selfreport questionnaires, executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, and informant-report questionnaires are used to measure self-control. Duckwort et al. (2011) discerned over 100 unique self- and informant-report questionnaires. Items on these questionnaires suggest considerable heterogeneity in the underlying constructs assessed. \n\nIf impulsivity is regarded as the converse of self-control, the same instrument to assess impulsivity (see dct:impulse_79n2r0t0) can potentially be used to measure self-control, applying reverse scoring.\n\n\n## Eliciting Construct Content (Qualitative Research)\n\nConduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative study, use these two questions (with preferably some questions in between): \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR how deliberate and controlled do you see your actions?\" and \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR how spontaneous do you see your actions?\".\n\nThese same questions are used to elicite expressions indicative of impulsivity (see dct:impulse_79n2r0t0).\n\n\n## Coding Qualitative Data\n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of self-control. In the context of behaviour change interventions (i.e. health behaviour changes), this self-control is regarded with respect to a specific behaviour or object.\n\nTrait self-control, i.e. self-control across situations, not specifically linked to a particular behaviour or object, is usually not the focus of interest. Therefore, expressions indicative of self-control should be coded as such only when they concern the behaviour or object of interest, unless beforehand another decision has been made.\n\nExpressions indicative of the presence of self-control may contain phrases such as \"I did not succumb to temptation X because I wanted to achieve goal X\" and \"I sticked to my plan, but sometimes it was difficult\". \n\nExpressions indicative of impulsivity should be coded as dct:impulse_79n2r0t0. Expressions that refer to an individual's perceptions of the degree to which he/she is capable of, or has control over, performing a given behaviour, should be coded as dct:perceivedBehavioralControl_73dnt603.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Definition\n\nPeople’s perceptions of their ability to effortful control over dominant responses with respect to the target behaviour.\n\n\n\n## Developing Measurement Instruments\n\nIn a meta-analysis of self-control measures, Duckwort et al.
