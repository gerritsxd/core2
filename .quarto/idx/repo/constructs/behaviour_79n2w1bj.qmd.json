However, one should take into account that these latter instruments by definition measure a subjective representation of behaviour. Moreover, whereas there is general agreement about the definition of a specific behaviour (\"running\"), this is not the case when asking about a broad behavioural category, such as \"exercising\". To assess a category of behaviours via self-report, therefore, we must provide a clear definition of the category in question and specify action, target, context, and time.\n\nDepending on the nature of the behaviour, engagement in the behaviour can be conceived as binary (i.e. one either does or does not engage in the target behaviour, e.g. getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter of frequency (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour with a frequency from zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g. the frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter of intensity (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour to a degree from zero up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g. the amount of kilocalories one consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g. how frequently one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).\n\nThe instructions for developing a self-report instrument to measure behaviour, logically derive from the foregoing consideration regarding the nature of the behaviour of interest. For example, for a dichotomous response option (yes/no) the question can be formulated in the following way: \"Did you get tested for STIs during the last six months?\". If the behaviour is a matter of frequency, multiple response options may be given, e.g.: \"During the last seven days, how many days did you drink two or more alcoholic drinks?\", with response options ranging from 0 to 7.\n\n\n## Coding Measurement Instruments\n\nInstruments that measure observable behaviour.

These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative study, the formulation of the question(s) depends on the nature of the behaviour, i.e. engagement in the behaviour can be conceived as binary (i.e. one either does or does not engage in the target behaviour, e.g. getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter of frequency (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour with a frequency from zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g. the frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter of intensity (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour to a degree from zero up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g. the amount of kilocalories one consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g. how frequently one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).\n\nIf engagement in the behaviour is conceived as binary, the interviewer can ask a question in the following fashion: \"Do you you perform BEHAVIOUR X?\", \"Do you you perform BEHAVIOUR X when at location X?\", or \"Did you you perform BEHAVIOUR X during period X?\".\n\nIf the interviewer is interested in the frequency the behaviour is performed, he/she can ask a question in the following fashion: \"During period X, how many days did you perform BEHAVIOUR X?\" or \"When you were at location X, how many times did you perform BEHAVIOUR X?\".\n\nIf the intensity of performance of the behaviour is the focus of interest, the interviewer can ask a question in the following fashion: \"On the days you performed BEHAVIOUR X during period X, how much/many did you take/consume?\" or \"On the days you performed BEHAVIOUR X during period X, how long did you engage in BEHAVIOUR X?\" \n\nIf both the frequency and intensity of engagement in the behaviour is of interest, the interviewer can formulate questions in the following way: \"During period X, how many days did you perform BEHAVIOUR X and for how long?\" or \"During period X, how many days did you perform BEHAVIOUR X and how much/many did you take/consume each time?\".\n\n\n## Coding Qualitative Data\n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply engagement in the behaviour of interest. These expressions may indicate engagement in the behaviour (yes/no), the frequency the behaviour is performed, the intensity with which the behaviour is performed, or a combination of the foregoing aspects. For example: \"I do not drink alcohol\", \"I only drink alcohol in the weekends\", \"When going clubbing I drink about 5 tot 6 beers\", or \"I drink one glass of wine each day with dinner\". \n\nExpressions that refer to either intentions, willingness, or specific plans to engage in the behaviour should not be coded as dct:behaviour_79n2w1bj, but as, respectively, dct:intention_73dnt604, dct:willingness_79n2fh4w, and dct:action_plan_79n2w1bh\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Definition\n\nAn individual’s manifest, observable activities in response to external or internal stimuli. \n\n## Developing Measurement Instruments\n\nThe prefered instruments to measure behaviour are observation by trained observers using a valid and reliable reporting protocol and/or the use of technical measures and devices to record and track behaviour during particular events and over time.\n\nIf these objective measures can not be used, self-report of behaviour assessed by questionniares or interviews are an alternative option.
