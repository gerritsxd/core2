Instrumental attitude belief evaluation always relate to specific instrumental attitude belief expectations, so the first step is to identify the expectation for which the evaluation should be measured (e.g. 'Drinking four cups of coffee every day leads to me being ... [much less healthy|much more healthy]' or 'Drinking four cups of coffee makes me ... [very idle|very productive]').

For example, an item could be 'I prefer ... [being much less healthy|being much more healthy]', and another items can be 'I prefer ... [being very idle|being very productive]'. Make sure to formulate the item stem such that it makes clear that you are asking people about *their* evaluation (not what they think holds more generally). Use a seven-point response scale and try to always be consistent in the scale valence; in languages that are read from left to right, always place the most passive/low/less/weak/unlikely scale extreme (anchor) on the left, and the most active/high/more/strong/likely scale extreme (anchor) on the right.
