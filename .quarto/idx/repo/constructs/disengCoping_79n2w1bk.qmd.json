Nevertheless, regardless of the specific instrument used, an individual overall response pattern can be classified as either being typical of engagement (dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengagement coping, with \"responses that are oriented toward either the source of stress, or toward one’s emotions and thoughts” representing engagement coping, while “responses that are oriented away from the stressor or one’s emotions/thoughts” indicating the dominant presence of a disengagement coping style (Compas et al., 2001). \n\nDisengagement coping  may be conceived at the highest level of a hierarchical factor structure with three levels (Tobin et al., 1989), with one level below, \"problem disengagement\" and \"emotion disengagement\", and at the lowest level, respectively, \"problem avoidance\" and \"wishful thinking\" (for problem disengagement), and \"self criticism\" and \"social withdrawal\" (for emotion disengagement).
