For self-report asessment, a statement such as \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR....\" can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of impulsivity. For example: \"When it comes to smoking cigarettes... 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don't manage to plan my behaviour; 4) I act on the spur of the moment; 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions; 6) I afterwards frequently regret that I smoked. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \"totally agree\" to \"totally disagree\".\n\nAlternatively, unique items can be created to measure behaviour- or object-related impulsivity, such as: \"When I hear a good track, I just have to turn off the volume restriction\" (for target behaviour \"use volume restriction on music players\") with responses \"totally agree\" and \"totally disagree\" as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale. \n\nBeside behaviour- or object-related impulsivity, impulsivity as a trait can be measured.

However, the scoring for the questionnaire items should be reversed (see dct:self_control_XXX for an example).\n\n## Eliciting Construct Content (Qualitative Research)\n\nConduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative study, use these two questions (with preferably some questions in between): \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR how deliberate and controlled do you see your actions?\" and \"When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR how spontaneous do you see your actions?\".\n\nThese same questions are used to elicite expressions indicative of self-control (see dct:self_control_XXX).\n\nIn addition, for the assessment of clinical levels of impulsivity in adults (e.g. in Attention Deficit Disorder), (semi) structured interview instruments exist such as the ACE+ (Young, 2016) and the MIDI (Grant, 2008).\n\n\n\n\n## Coding Qualitative Data\n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply the presence or absence of impulsivity. In the context of behaviour change interventions (i.e. health behaviour changes), this impulsivity is regarded with respect to a specific behaviour or object. Trait impulsivity, i.e. impulsivity across situations, not specifically linked to a particular behaviour or object, is usually not the focus of interest. Therefore, expressions indicative of impulsivity should be coded as such only when they concern the behaviour or object of interest, unless beforehand another decision has been made.
