Questionnnaire items to measure self-monitoring with respect to the target behaviour can, for example, be formulated in the following way: \"By counting the number of alcoholic drinks, I know exactly how much alcohol I consume during a night clubbing\" or \"I use a diary or mobile app to track my daily food consumption\". Response can be either dichotomous (yes/no) or three response options can be provided (\"Does not apply\", \"More or less\", \"Does apply\"). Social desirability and distorted remembrance of events may result in incongruences between actual and reported self-monitoring behaviour with this asssessment procedure. \n\n2) An alternative way to assess an individual's self-monitoring behaviour is to ask participants to keep a diary or use a mobile app (e.g. ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) ), internet program, or technical device to keep track of their self-monitoring actions with respect to the target behaviour, e.g. by asking youngsters to make a report each time they are aware to be exposed to music that is too loud (> 100 decibel) during a night out with the help of a mobile app. By asking people to report their self-monitoring behaviour, this behaviour, however, changes and is no longer a reflection of a person's actual self-monitoring behaviour. \n\n\n## Coding Measurement Instruments\n\nQuestions or questionnaires that measure the degree to which an individual engages in self-monitoring with respect to the target behaviour. Items to measure self-reported self-monitoring with respect to a particular (health) behaviour are, for example: \"By counting the number of alcoholic drinks, I know exactly how much alcohol I consume during a night clubbing\" or \"I use a diary or mobile app to track my daily food consumption\". Response can be either dichotomous (yes/no) or three response options can be provided (\"Does not apply\", \"More or less\", \"Does apply\").\n\nParticipants may also be asked to keep a diary or use a mobile app, internet program, or technical device to keep track of their self-monitoring actions with respect to the target behaviour, e.g. by asking youngsters to make a report each time they are aware to be exposed to music that is too loud (> 100 decibel) during a night out with the help of a mobile app. However, by asking people to monitor their self-monitoring behaviour, this behaviour changes and is no longer a reflection of a person's actual self-monitoring behaviour. \n\nNote that self-monitoring as a personal capacity is the topic of interest here. Asking a person (e.g. a patient) to self-monitor his or her (health) behaviour may yield valuable information that other measurement methods (e.g. questionniare, interview) possibly can not provide, e.g. by keeping track of the activity and sleeping patterns of bipolar patients the development of the disease can be predicted and altered. Self-monitoring is also a valuable behaviour change technique; by increasing insight in their actions, people may be instigated to modify their (problem) behaviour. However, as said, self-monitoring as individual skill, and not self-monitoring as research method or behaviour change technique, is of interest here.\n\nThe term \"self-monitoring\" is also used in popular language and research to describe the personality trait along which people differ in their abilities and desires to change their self-presentations, expressive behaviour, and nonverbal affective displays. This is a different construct from the one discussed here and should not be coded as such. The Self Monitoring Scale (Snyder et al, 1974) is a questionnaire that is used to measure this construct.\n\n## Eliciting Construct Content (Qualitative Research)\n\nConduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative study, use the following introduction and question(s): \"People differ in the degree they monitor their behaviour\", followed by: \"Do you keep an eye on your engagement in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?\" (if response is \"Yes\":) \"How do you keep track of your engagement in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?\" (e.g. \"How do you keep track of your smoking behaviour?\").\n\n\n## Coding Qualitative Data\n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply the presence or absence of self-monitoring with regard to the target behaviour. For example: \"I weigh my body weight every day\" or \"I keep a diary to help me understand why I feel stressed at certain moments\". \n\nNote that the term \"self-monitoring\" is also used in popular language and research to describe the personality trait along which people differ in their abilities and desires to change their self-presentations, expressive behaviour, and nonverbal affective displays.
