  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'An individual''s image of the typical person who performs (or does
      not perform) a given behaviour (i.e. the "prototype") can be assessed by measuring
      the subconstructs prototype favourability (see dct:prototypeFavourability_79n2fh4t)
      and prototype similarity (see dct:prototypeSimilarity_79n2fh4t).


      When the prototype performs the target behaviour, higher prototype favourability
      and similarity are, in general, related to an increased likelihood that an individual
      will engage in the behaviour, or will exhibit the willingness or intention to
      engage in the behaviour associated with the prototype (vice versa, when the
      protoptype abstains from performing the behaviour, higher prototype favourability
      and similarity are related to a decreased likelihood that an individual will
      engage in the behaviour).


      In addition, analyzing the interaction between prototype favourability and similarity
      can increase predictive validity (Van Lettow et al., 2016). For example, in
      the study by Rivis et al. (2011) more favourable perceptions of the drink-driver
      prototype were associated with greater willingness to drink and drive at high
      (but not moderate or low) levels of prototype similarity.

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.


      In this qualitative study, use the questions: "How would you describe the typical
      person that engages (or: does not engage) in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?" or "What is
      your image of the typical person that engages (or: does not engage) in TARGET
      BEHAVIOUR?"

  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions that exhibit the presence of a prototype image associated
      with the performance of a behaviour (or abstaining from it) without a reference
      to favourability or similarity. For example in the answer "These people are
      very health concious" in response to the question "What is your image of the
      typical person that does not drink alcohol?" no clear aspect of favourability
      or similarity is apparent. However, a reference to a prototypical image is nevertheless
      made.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of favourability, containing
      adjunctives such as "smart/dumb", "attractive/unattractive", "desirable/undiserable"
      should be coded as dct:prototypeFavourability_79n2fh4t.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of similarity, containing adjunctives
      such as "familiar/unfamiliar",  "related/unrelated", "resemble/differ" should
      be coded as dct:prototypeSimilarity_79n2fh4t.
