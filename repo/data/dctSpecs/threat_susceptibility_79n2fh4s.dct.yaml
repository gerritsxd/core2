    instruction: 'Use 5- or 7-point Likert scales that measure the perceived susceptibility
      to the (health) threat in question, e.g. "I am at risk for getting HEALTH THREAT"  and
      "It is possible that I get HEALTH THREAT" with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly
      agree" as anchors.


      Examples of items measuring the perceived susceptibility to a health threat
      are: "It is likely that I will get infected with HIV" and "It is possible that
      I will get infected with HIV", with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly agree"
      as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale (examples are from the Risk Behaviour Diagnosis
      Scale [Witte et al., 1995]).

    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.


      In this qualitative study, use the questions: "How would you rate the risk associated
      with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?" or "Can you describe your personal
      ideas of the risk associated with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?".

      high/low prevalence\", \"likely/unlikely\", and \"nobody I know\"/\"a lot of\
      \ people I know\" (the latter two responses refering to adverse consequences\
      \ of engaging in the target [risk] behaviour). \n\nExpressions that demonstrate\
      \ or imply the degree of perceived threat severity, containing verbs such as\
      \ \"very/not very severe\",  \"malicious/benign\", and \"great disturbance\"\
      /\"minor annoyance\" should be coded as dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r.  \n\n\
