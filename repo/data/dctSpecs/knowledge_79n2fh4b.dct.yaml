  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'Knowledge can be measured by presenting statements about parts of
      reality (i.e. about objects or relationships that exist or do not exist in the
      world) related to the target behaviour, and determining a participant''s belief
      concerning this statement by using a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from "certainly
      not true" through "probably not true", "no idea", "certainly true", "certaintly
      true".


      An example of such an item for the target behaviour "protecing hearing against
      exposure to loud noise" is: "Exposure to very loud music (>120 decibel) can
      lead to acute and permanent hearing loss" or "When volume restriction is switched
      on for a MP-3 player sold in E.U., the maximum attainable level of decibels
      is 85."

  measure_code:
    instruction: 'Questions that measure participants'' beliefs concerning statements
      about reality (i.e. about objects or relationships that exist or do not exist
      in the world) related to the target behaviour. These beliefs can be determined
      by using a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from "certainly not true" through
      "probably not true", "no idea", "certainly true", "certaintly true".


      Two examples for the target behaviour "protecing hearing against exposure to
      loud noise" are: "Exposure to very loud music (>120 decibel) can lead to acute
      and permanent hearing loss" and  "When volume restriction is switched on for
      a MP-3 player sold in E.U. the maximum attainable level of decibels is 85."'
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.


      In this qualitative study, participants are asked to express their knowledge
      regarding  the target behaviour or topics related to the target behaviour.


      These question can be formulated in the following way: "What do you know about
      TARGET BEHAVIOUR?" and "What do you know about POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE OF (NOT)
      ENGAGING IN TARGET BEHAVIOUR?" For example: "What do you know about noise-induced
      hearing loss?" and "What do you know about the effect of loud noise on the hearing?"

      '
  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence or absence of
      knowledge concerning the target behaviour or topics related to the target behaviour.
      These expressions pertain to structural or causal characteristics of the natural
      world. Importantly, these are separate from, for example, one''s evaluations
      of those characteristics. E.g. "smoking causes lung cancer" is knowledge; "if
      I smoke, I get lung cancer" is expectation; "I don''t like lung cancer" is evaluation.
