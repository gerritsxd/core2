  definition:
    definition: Risk perception is the perceived susceptibility to and the perceived
      severity of a threat.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Risk perception is determined by the perceived susceptibility (see\
      \ dct:threat_susceptibility_79n2fh4s) to and the perceived severity (see dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r)\
      \ of a (health) threat, i.e. it is the product term of the multiplication of\
      \ these component constructs. \n\nSee dct:threat_susceptibility_79n2fh4s and\
      \ dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r for instructions for developing measurement instruments\
      \ for these subconstructs. The resulting measurements express the degree of\
      \ susceptibility and severity as a numeric score which, subsequently, can be\
      \ multiplicated to estimate an individual's perception of the level of risk\
      \ associated with a threat.\n\nInstead of multiplying the two subcomponents,\
      \ threat susceptibility and threat severity are also summed by some risk perception\
      \ measures, e.g. the 12-item Risk Behaviour Diagnosis (RBD) Scale (Witte et\
      \ al., 1995) includes 3 items measuring threat susceptibility and 3 items measuring\
      \ threat severity on a 5-point Likert scale. Together these 6 (summed) items\
      \ scores determine a participant's risk perception (there named \"perceived\
      \ threat\").\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: 'Risk perception is measured by measuring both of the component constructs:
      perceived threat susceptibility (see dct:threat_susceptibility_79n2fh4s) and
      perceived threat severity (see dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r) and, subsequently,
      multiplying or summing the scores of these two components.'
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.


      In this qualitative study, use the questions: "How would you rate the risk associated
      with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?" or "Can you describe your personal
      ideas of the risk associated with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?"

      '
  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions that illustrate the participant''s risk perception with
      regard to the health threat (e.g. the target behaviour) without a reference
      to susceptibility or severity.


      For example, if the question is "Can you describe your personal ideas of the
      risk associated with smoking cigarettes?" and the response is "I know there
      is a risk associated with smoking, so I try not to smoke to much" no clear reference
      is made to to the severity of the threat or to personal susceptibility.  However,
      a reference to a risk perception is nevertheless made.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of perceived threat susceptibility,
      containing phrases and words such as "high/low risk", "high/low prevalence",
      "likely/unlikely", "nobody I know"/"a lot of people I know" (the latter two
      responses refering to adverse consequences of engaging in the target behaviour)
      should be coded as dct:threat_susceptibility_79n2fh4s.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of perceived threat severity,
      containing verbs such as "very/not very severe",  "malicious/benign", "great
      disturbance"/"minor annoyance" should be coded as dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r.
