      \ the target activity is controlled by identified regulation.\n\nThe Situational\
      \ Motivation Scale (SIMS) (Guay et al., 2000) is a frequently used self-report\
      \ instrument to assess identified regulation of behaviour. Beside identified\
      \ regulation of behaviour, the SIMS assesses intrinsic regulation, external\
      \ regulation, and amotivation, and is used to assess motivation for various\
      \ activities (e.g. physical exercise, academic performance). \n\nThe SIMS asks\
      \ participants \u201CWhy are you currently engaged in this activity?\u201D.\
      \ Scale items represent potential answers to this question. Responses are given\
      \ on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from \"Does not correspond at all\" to \"\

    instruction: 'Expressions that demonstrate or imply that engagement in the target
      behaviour is controlled by identified regulation, using phrases such as "Because
      I am doing it for my own good" and "Because I believe this activity is important
      for me".


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of externally regulated behaviour
      should be coded as dct:extBehaviour_79n2r0sz.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of introjected regulation
      of behaviour should be coded as dct:introjBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of integrated regulation
      of behaviour should be coded as dct:integratedBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      In practice, it can be difficult to distinguish expressions belonging to the
      four types of extrinsic motivation (external, introjected, identified, and integrated
      self-regulation). Therefore, a less precise categorization can be made between
      controlled and autonomous motivation. External and introjected regulation belonging
      to the first category, and identified and integrated self-regulation belonging
      to the first category. When this dichotomous categorization of extrinsic motivation
      is maintained, expressions typical of identified and integrated self-regulation
      can be grouped together.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of intrinsic regulation of
      behaviour should be coded as dct:intrinsicBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the absence of motivation to engage in
      the target behaviour (i.e. "amotivation") should be coded as dct:motivation_79n2fh4q,
      and in a supplementary comment scored "0" or "absent".


      Expressions that refer to the presence of motivation with regard to the target
      behaviour without specifying the nature of its regulation or expressions that
      refer to the presence of motivation in general should be coded dct:motivation_79n2fh4q.'
