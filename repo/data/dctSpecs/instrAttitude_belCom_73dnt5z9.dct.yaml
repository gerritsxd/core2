    definition: The sum of the instrumental attitude beliefs.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'A composite of instrumental attitude beliefs is obtained by multiplying
      the expectations of each instrumental attitude belief (see dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6)
      by its evaluation (see dct:instrAttitude_evaluation_73dnt5z7) and then summing
      the product terms across all instrumental attitude beliefs. This, preferably,
      is represented graphically (e.g. in a table or index) and, additionally, in
      an equation.


      The authors state on p.104 of  the Reasoned Action Approach book (Ajzen & Fishbein,
      2010) that the composite measure of beliefs is assumed to determine the (instrumental)
      attitude, and should not be interpreted as an indirect measure of (instrumental)
      attitude. A low correlation between the beliefs composite and a direct measure
      of instrumental attitude may be an indication that the expectancy-value index
      (i.e. the attitude beliefs composite) is based on an inappropriate set of (nonsalient)
      beliefs, or that the measure of belief strength may be scored inappropriately.

  measure_code:
    instruction: 'Questions or questionnaires that measure the expectations (dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6)
      and evaluations (dct:instrAttitude_evaluation_73dnt5z7) of all salient instrumental
      attitude beliefs with regard to the target behaviour.


      Instrumental attitude belief expectations combine multiplicatively with  instrumental
      attitude belief evaluations into  instrumental attitude beliefs. The product
      terms for each belief and the sum of the products terms of all salients beliefs
      are represented in the expectancy-value index (i.e. the compostite of attitude
      beliefs) for the target behaviour. See Table 3.2 on p. 98 of  the Reasoned Action
      Approach book (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010) for an example of such an index.
