    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are individually
      interviewed in a free-response format, and the interviews are either recorded
      and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction
      for aspect coding. In this qualitative study, use these three questions: ''What
      do you see as the advantages of LOUD SOUND during sport/music/nightlife events'',
      ''What do you see as the disadvantages of LOUD SOUND during sport/music/nightlife
      events?'' and ''What else comes to mind when you think about LOUD SOUND during
      sport/music/nightlife events?''.
