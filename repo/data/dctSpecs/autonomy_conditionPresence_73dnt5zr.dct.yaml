  definition:
    definition: 'The perceived presence of a condition refers to the perceived probability
      that a condition will be present that may have some power to facilitate or obstruct
      successfully accomplishing the target behavior. Such conditions are perceived
      to be external to the individuals direct control (though they may in reality
      be internal conditions; for example, addicts may perceive their craving to be
      irresistible, and as such, a condition they have no control over and that negatively
      impacts their autonomy). Facilitating or obstructing factors that are perceived
      to be internal (i.e. that an individual can learn over time) are subskills (see
      dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy).


      Each perceived presence of a condition concerns the absence or presence of one
      condition. The perceived nature of the condition (i.e. whether it facilitates
      or obstructs the target behavior), i.e. the perceived power of that condition,
      is covered in dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs.


      According to the Reasoned Action Approach, perceptions about the presence of
      conditions combine multiplicatively with perceptions about the power of conditions
      (see dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs) into autonomy beliefs (see dct:autonomy_belief_73dnt5zt).


      Examples of perceived presence of a condition are the perception that to buy
      condoms, one will have to ask for them at the counter (which may obstruct buying
      condoms); the perception that it is raining (which may obstruct going for a
      run); the perception that healthy food is very expensive (which may obstruct
      buying healthy food); the perception that testing for STIs is free (which may
      facilitate getting tested for STIs); and the perception that anticonception
      is widely available (which may facilitate using anticonception).'

    instruction: 'The perceived presence of a condition is measured by asking the
      perceived probability that a condition will be present. A unidimensional scale
      is required. The items are formulated as ''How likely do you think it is that
      [CONDITION]?'' with anchors ''Very unlikely'' and ''Very likely''.


      For example, ''How likely do you think it is that it will rain?'' and ''How
      likely do you think it is that anticonception will be widely available?'', both
      with anchors ''Very unlikely'' and ''Very likely''.'
