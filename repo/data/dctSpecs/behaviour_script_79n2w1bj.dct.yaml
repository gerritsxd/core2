  definition:
    definition: Organized sets of information stored schematically linking the action
      with cues and contexts built up through repeated past experience.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Behavioural scripts describe the sequencing of events involving
      observable, recurrent activities and patterns of interaction characteristic
      of a particular setting. As can be deduced from this definition, behavioral
      script can be observed. This measurement method is, however, very time intensive
      and unpractical. \n\nThe presence of behavioural scripts can also be assessed
      by self-report, using interviews and questionnaires as research methods. However,
      no specific questionnaires exist to measure the presence of behavioural scripts.
      Therefore, one could use a questionnaire to measure habitual behaviour, such
      as the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) (see dct:habit_79n2r0sz), and possibly
      apply some modifications to this measure, or develop a new questionnaire from
      scratch.\n\nA questionnaire measuring behavioural scripts for a particular behaviour
      can present different scenarios (each representing a particular behavioural
      script) and ask whether the participant performs the target behaviour in this
      fashion, with \"Very likely\" and \"Very unlikely\" at the extreme ends of a
      5- or 7-point Likert scale. For example \"When I am at a club or festival I
      usually get offered a couple of alcoholic drinks from friends, even when I don't
      aks for them\", \"When I am at a club or festival and a stranger bumps into
      me, I don't pay attention to it or start an argument, and I continue my way\"
      and \"When I am at a club or festival I first walk around at the event to see
      who is there.\"\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: |
      Questions or questionnaires that measure the degree to which performance of the target behaviour follows certain behavioural scripts. These fixed behavioural patters may be prompted by certain cues or certain situations.

      Questions measuring the presence of behavioural scripts for a particular behaviour can present different scenarios (each representing a particualr behavioural script) and ask whether the participant performs the target behaviour in this fashion, with "Very likely" and "Very unlikely" at the extreme ends of a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. For example "When I am at a club or festival, I usually get offered a couple of alcoholic drink from friends, even when I don't aks for them", "When I am at a club or festival and a stranger bumps into me, I don't pay attention to it or start an argument, and I continue my way" and "When I am at a club or festival, I first walk around at the event to see who is there."
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: |
      Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding. In this qualitative study, use questions similar to the following examples: "Please describe how your engagement in the TARGET BEHAVIOUR looks like when at location X" or "Please describe the things you usually do before, during, and after you engage in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?". For example, "Please describe the things you usually do before, during, and after you use cannabis?".
  aspect_code:
    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of behavioural
      scripts, using expressions suchs as: \"When at X I always do X\", \"Without
      thinking about it, I first do X, then I do X, and then I do X\", \"Every day
      I follow the same sequence of actions....\". More specifically, for example:
      \"When I drink my first cup of coffee, I automatically light a cigarette. After
      I have finished my coffee and cigarette, I go to the toilet\" \n\nBehavioural
      scripts are related to dct:habit_79n2r0sz and the constructs may overlap."
