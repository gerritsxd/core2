    definition: People’s perceptions of the degree to which they are capable of, or
      have control over, performing a given behavior.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: |
      Use Likert scales that measure the degree to which participants believe the target behavior to be under their control and something they are capable of performing successfully, for example by measuring their perceived capacity and perceived autonomy to perform the target behavior.

      The items suggested in the 2010 RAA book are: ‘I am confident that if I want to, I can TARGET BEHAVIOR.’ with anchors ‘No confidence at all’ vs ‘A lot of confidence’; ‘Whether I TARGET BEHAVIOR is …’ with anchors ‘Not up to me’ vs ‘Completely up to me’; ‘If I really wanted to, I could TARGET BEHAVIOR.’ with anchors ‘Unlikely’ vs ‘Likely’; and ‘For me to TARGET BEHAVIOR is under my control.’ with anchors ‘Not at all’ vs ‘Completely’. If only the first and third of these items are measured, the ‘Capacity’ construct is measured instead. If only the second and fourth items are measured, the ‘Autonomy’ construct is measured instead.

      Note that questions about how easy or difficult participants perceive a target behavior to be fall outside of the constructs of Perceived Behavioral Control, Autonomy, and Capacity as defined in the 2010 RAA book (see also the discussion on page 164).
  measure_code:
    instruction: |
      Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived degree to which the target behavior or the contrast behavior is both under the control of the target population individual and something they are confident they can successfully perform. If only one aspect is measured (i.e. only control or only confidence), code this as the ‘Autonomy’ or ‘Capacity’ constructs.

      For example, the items suggested in the book are: ‘I am confident that if I want to, I can TARGET BEHAVIOR.’ with anchors ‘No confidence at all’ vs ‘A lot of confidence’; ‘Whether I TARGET BEHAVIOR is …’ with anchors ‘Not up to me’ vs ‘Completely up to me’; ‘If I really wanted to, I could TARGET BEHAVIOR.’ with anchors ‘Unlikely’ vs ‘Likely’; and ‘For me to TARGET BEHAVIOR is under my control.’ with anchors ‘Not at all’ vs ‘Completely’. If only the first and third of these items are measured, the ‘Capacity’ construct should be coded instead. If only the second and fourth items are measured, the ‘Autonomy’ construct should be coded instead.
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: |
      Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.

      In this qualitative study, use these questions: ‘Please list any factors or circumstances that would make it easy or enable you to target behavior.’ and ‘Please list any factors or circumstances that would make it difficult or prevent you from target behavior.’
  aspect_code:
    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply that one perceives behavioural
      control with regard to the target behaviour to be present or absent. These are
      general expressions of perceived behavioural control, i.e. not refering specifically
      to the ability or autonomy to perform the behaviour, e.g.: \"Only time will
      tell if I will be able to follow the entire exercise program\".\n\nExpressions
      that demonstrate or imply either the presence/absence of confidence about one’s
      ability to perform the target behavior, should be coded as dct:capacity_73dnt602.
      An example of a statement expressing the capacity to perform the target behaviour
      is: \"I am confident that I have the required muscle strength to perform all
      the exercises of the prescribed program\". \n\nExpressions that demonstrate
      or imply the presence/absence of confidence about one’s control over performance
      or nonperformance of the target behavior (i.e. if (non)performance is \"up to
      them\"), for example because of a barrier, obstacle, or facilitating condition
      or circumstance, should be coded as dct:autonomy_73dnt5zx. An example of a statement
      expressing the perceived autonomy to perform the target behaviour is: \"My exercising
      for at least 20 minutes, three times per week, is up to me\".\n"
