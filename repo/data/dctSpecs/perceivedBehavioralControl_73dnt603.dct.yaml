  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Use Likert scales that measure the degree to which participants\
      \ believe the target behavior to be under their control and something they are\
      \ capable of performing successfully, for example by measuring their perceived\
      \ capacity and perceived autonomy to perform the target behavior.\n\nThe items\
      \ suggested in the 2010 RAA book are: \u2018I am confident that if I want to,\
      \ I can TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018No confidence at all\u2019\
      \ vs \u2018A lot of confidence\u2019; \u2018Whether I TARGET BEHAVIOR is \u2026\
      \u2019 with anchors \u2018Not up to me\u2019 vs \u2018Completely up to me\u2019\
      ; \u2018If I really wanted to, I could TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018\
      Unlikely\u2019 vs \u2018Likely\u2019; and \u2018For me to TARGET BEHAVIOR is\
      \ under my control.\u2019 with anchors \u2018Not at all\u2019 vs \u2018Completely\u2019\
      . If only the first and third of these items are measured, the \u2018Capacity\u2019\
      \ construct is measured instead. If only the second and fourth items are measured,\
      \ the \u2018Autonomy\u2019 construct is measured instead.\n\nNote that questions\
      \ about how easy or difficult participants perceive a target behavior to be\
      \ fall outside of the constructs of Perceived Behavioral Control, Autonomy,\
      \ and Capacity as defined in the 2010 RAA book (see also the discussion on page\
      \ 164).\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived degree to\
      \ which the target behavior or the contrast behavior is both under the control\
      \ of the target population individual and something they are confident they\
      \ can successfully perform. If only one aspect is measured (i.e. only control\
      \ or only confidence), code this as the \u2018Autonomy\u2019 or \u2018Capacity\u2019\
      \ constructs.\n\nFor example, the items suggested in the book are: \u2018I am\
      \ confident that if I want to, I can TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018\
      No confidence at all\u2019 vs \u2018A lot of confidence\u2019; \u2018Whether\

      Not at all\u2019 vs \u2018Completely\u2019. If only the first and third of these\
      \ items are measured, the \u2018Capacity\u2019 construct should be coded instead.\
      \ If only the second and fourth items are measured, the \u2018Autonomy\u2019\
      \ construct should be coded instead.\n"
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,\
      \ and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept.\
      \ These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\n\
      In this qualitative study, use these questions: \u2018Please list any factors\
      \ or circumstances that would make it easy or enable you to target behavior.\u2019\

  aspect_code:
    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply that one perceives behavioural\
      \ control with regard to the target behaviour to be present or absent. These\
      \ are general expressions of perceived behavioural control, i.e. not refering\
      \ specifically to the ability or autonomy to perform the behaviour, e.g.: \"\
      Only time will tell if I will be able to follow the entire exercise program\"\
      .\n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply either the presence/absence of confidence\
      \ about one\u2019s ability to perform the target behavior, should be coded as\
      \ dct:capacity_73dnt602. An example of a statement expressing the capacity to\
      \ perform the target behaviour is: \"I am confident that I have the required\
      \ muscle strength to perform all the exercises of the prescribed program\".\

      \ about one\u2019s control over performance or nonperformance of the target\
      \ behavior (i.e. if (non)performance is \"up to them\"), for example because\
      \ of a barrier, obstacle, or facilitating condition or circumstance, should\
      \ be coded as dct:autonomy_73dnt5zx. An example of a statement expressing the\
      \ perceived autonomy to perform the target behaviour is: \"My exercising for\
      \ at least 20 minutes, three times per week, is up to me\".\n"
