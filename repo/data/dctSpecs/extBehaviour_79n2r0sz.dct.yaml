    instruction: "The degree to which engagement in the target activity is externally\
      \ regulated can be assessed by asking participants \u201CWhy are you currently\
      \ engaged in this activity?\u201D and representing a series of items containing\
      \ potential answers to this question. Responses to each item are given on a\
      \ 7-point Likert scale ranging from \"Does not correspond at all\" to \"Corresponds\
      \ exactly\".\n\nExamples of items expressing externally regulated behaviour\
      \ are: \"Because I am supposed to do it\", \"Because it is something that I\
      \ have to do\", and \"Because I feel that I have to do it\".\n\nThe procedure\
      \ and items described here are from the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS)\
      \ (Guay et al., 2000). Beside items containing statements deemed typical for\
      \ externally regulated behaviour, the SIMS contains items to assess identified\
      \ regulation, intrinsic regulation, and amotivation. The items belonging to\
      \ each particular subscale are summed to assess which motivational construct\
      \ dominates. The SIMS is used to assess motivation for various activities such\
      \ as physical exercise and academic performance. "

    instruction: "Instruments that measure the degree to which engagement in the target\
      \ activity is externally regulated.\n\nThe Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS)\
      \ (Guay et al., 2000) is a frequently used self-report instrument to assess\
      \ whether behaviour is externally regulated. Beside external regulation of behaviour,\
      \ the SIMDS assesses identified regulation, intrinsic regulation, and amotivation,\
      \ and is used to assess motivation for various activities (e.g. physical exercise,\
      \ academic performance). \n\nThe SIMS asks participants \u201CWhy are you currently\
      \ engaged in this activity?\u201D. Scale items represent potential answers to\
      \ this question. Responses are given on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from\

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,\
      \ and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept.\
      \ These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\n\
      In this qualitative study, use this question: \u201CWhy are you currently engaged\
      \ in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?\u201D \n\nFor example: \"Why do you currently wear ear\
      \ plugs at concerts?\" or \"Why do you currently follow a calorie-restricted\

  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions that demonstrate or imply that engagement in the target
      behaviour is externally regulated, using phrases such as "Because I am supposed
      to do it" and "Because it is something that I have to do".


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of introjected regulation
      of behaviour should be coded as dct:introjBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of identified regulation
      of behaviour should be coded as dct:identifiedBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of integrated regulation
      of behaviour should be coded as dct:integratedBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      In practice, it can be difficult to distinguish expressions belonging to the
      four types of extrinsic motivation (external, introjected, identified, and integrated
      self-regulation). Therefore, a less precise categorization can be made between
      controlled and autonomous motivation: external and introjected regulation belonging
      to the first category, and identified and integrated self-regulation belonging
      to the first category.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of intrinsically regulated
      behaviour should be coded as dct:intrinsicBehaviour_79n2r0t0.


      Expressions that demonstrate or imply the absence of motivation to engage in
      the target behaviour (i.e. "amotivation") should be coded as dct:motivation_79n2fh4q,
      and in a supplementary comment scored "0" or "absent".


      Expressions that refer to the presence of motivation with regard to the target
      behaviour without specifying the nature of its regulation or expressions that
      refer to the presence of motivation in general should be coded dct:motivation_79n2fh4q.
