    definition: "The sum of the autonomy beliefs. In their totality, autonomy beliefs\
      \ lead to the perception that performance or nonperformance of the target behaviour\
      \ is under their control or is up to them. \n"

    instruction: "A composite of autonomy beliefs is obtained by multiplying the strength\
      \ of each autonomy belief (see dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) by its\
      \ perceived power (see dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs) and then summing\
      \ the product terms across all autonomy beliefs.\n\nThis, preferably, is represented\
      \ graphically (e.g. in a table or index) and, additionally, in an equation.\
      \ See Table 5.5 on p.171 of the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) book (Ajzen &\
      \ Fishbein, 2010) for an example. \n"

    instruction: "The autonomy beliefs composite reflects the summation of salient\
      \ autonomy beliefs with regard to the target behaviour. Each autonomy belief\
      \  (dct:autonomy_belief_73dnt5zt), in its turn, is the product term of the multiplication\
      \ of the strength of the belief (dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) by\
      \ its perceived power (dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs).\n\nGiven the formative\
      \ nature of the autonomy beliefs composite, for a swift and clear overview of\
      \ its composition and its effect on autonomy (see: autonomy_73dnt5zx), preferably\
      \ a graphical representation (e.g. a table or index) and, possibly, an equation\
      \ is consulted. Table 5.5 on p.171 of Reasoned Action Approach book (Ajzen &\
      \ Fishbein, 2010) represents such an overview. \n"
