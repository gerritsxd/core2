  definition:
    definition: "People form representations of the world, and some of those representations\
      \ pertain to the self. This set of attributes together form one\u2019s general\
      \ self-identity (i.e. unrelated to specific behaviors). However, most of these\
      \ attributes are relatively trivial (e.g. all humans have a brain, but brains\
      \ are usually not part of their self-identity). How central a given attribute\
      \ is to one\u2019s self-identity in general (its centrality) can depend on the\
      \ degree to which it is perceived to distinguish one from others, confers positive\
      \ characteristics, or is instrumental. For example, health is seen as desirable,\
      \ so being \u2018a healthy eater\u2019 is desirable. Similarly, if sophistication\
      \ is seen as desirable, and having well-developed tastes are seen as indicative\
      \ of sophistication, then being somebody who is very picky about one\u2019s\
      \ coffee blends and preparation methods can be seen as desirable. As a final\
      \ example of an instrumental function of self-identity, being \u2018an addict\u2019\
      \ can be used to excuse relapse.\n\nAlso, a given attribute can be more or less\
      \ related to a given target behavior (e.g. being a \u2018vegan\u2019 is intrinsically\
      \ related to eating behaviors). Given that one\u2019s self-identity is defined\
      \ as all these attributes that pertain to one\u2019s self (weighted by their\
      \ centrality), it follows that for different people, a given target behavior\
      \ can be differentially relevant to their self-identity. In terms of operationalizations,\
      \ this implies that this relevance of a behavior to one\u2019s self-identity\
      \ should be what is measured (note that this is not the same as general relevance\
      \ of a behavior)."
  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'As a so-called "direct measure", the items recommended by Snippe
      et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ygpmw) can be used.


      According to the definition of self-identity in this DCT, if a target behavior
      is strongly associated to somebody''s self-identity, to the degree that this
      is not only a reflection of the frequency or intensity with which they engage
      in that behavior, this association reflects the fact that one or more attributes
      is simultaneously connected to the target behavior and central to one''s self-identity.


      Therefore, to map the construct content for a given target behavior, for each
      attribute dimension along which self-identification can occur, two things have
      to be measured. First, that attribute''s centrality: the degree to which people
      consider that attribute a part of their self-identity. Second, the strength
      of that attribute''s association to the target behavior.'
