    instruction: "The measurement of injunctive norm beliefs starts with an elicitation\
      \ study to identify the content of injunctive norm beliefs about the behaviour\
      \ which are shared by the target population. \n\nTo obtain quantitative data\
      \ regarding injunctive norm beliefs, the participant is subsequently asked to\
      \ respond to two questions with respect to each injunctive norm belief, one\
      \ to assess the perceived approval or disapproval of a social referent (see\
      \ dct:referentApproval_73dnt5zd) and the other to measure  the motivation to\
      \ comply with that referent (see dct:motivationToComply_73dnt5zf). \n\nFinally,\
      \ to get a total quantitative score of a descriptive norm belief, the perceived\
      \ behaviour of a social referent is multiplied by the identification with that\
      \ social referent. The total score of a injunctive norm belief enables the assessment\
      \ of the importance of the contribution of an injunctive norm belief, in comparison\
      \ with other injunctive norm beliefs, to the injunctive norm beliefs composite\
      \ (see dct:injNorms_belCom_73dnt5zh). \n            "
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Each injunctive norm belief is the product term of the multiplication\
      \ of the perceived approval or disapproval of a given normative referent (see\
      \ dct:referentApproval_73dnt5zd) by the motivation to comply with that referent\
      \  (see dct:motivationToComply_73dnt5zf).  \n\nTherefore, whether an injunctive\
      \ norm belief exerts influence (and if so, to what extent) on the injunctivenorm\
      \ beliefs composite (see dct:injNorms_belCom_73dnt5zh), and whether a particular\
      \ injunctive norm belief lowers or increases the perception that salient injunctive\
      \ referents think one should perform the behaviour in question, can only be\
      \ deduced by concurrent consultation of the two subcomponents of which it is\
      \ constructed. Table 4.1 on p. 136 of the Reasoned Action Approach book (Ajzen\
      \ & Fishbein, 2010) provides an example how the two subcomponents exert an influence\
      \ on the formation of individual injunctive normative beliefs.\n"
