  definition:
    definition: "Beliefs are defined as the subjective probability that an object\
      \ has a certain attribute, where \u2018object\u2019 and \u2018attribute\u2019\
      \ are used in the generic sense, and refer to any discriminable aspect of an\
      \ individual\u2019s world. Conform the expectancy-value model of attitude, beliefs\
      \ are the product of the expectation that engaging in a behavior will have a\
      \ given consequence and the evaluation of that consequence as (very) negative\
      \ or (very) positive. Instrumental attitude beliefs concern beliefs about consequences\
      \ of engaging in the behavior for achieving one\u2019s goals.\n"
  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'Instrumental attitude beliefs are measured by measuring both of
      the component constructs, i.e.: dct:instrAttitude_evaluation_73dnt5z7 and dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6.

      '
  measure_code:
    instruction: 'Each instrumental attitude belief is the product term of the multiplication
      of the evaluation of the perceived  instrumentall consequences of the target
      behaviour (dct:instrAttitude_evaluation_73dnt5z7) by the perceived likelihood
      that engaging in the behaviour will actually have these consequences (dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6).


      Therefore, whether an  instrumental attitude belief exerts influence (and if
      so, to what extent) on the instrumental attitude beliefs composite (dct:instrAttitude_belCom_73dnt5z9),
      and whether a particular instrumental attitude belief leads to a more favourable
      or more unfavourable instrumental attitude towards performing the target behaviour,
      can only be deduced by concurrent consultation of the two subcomponents of which
      it is constructed. Table 3.2 on p. 98 of  the Reasoned Action Approach book
      (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010) illustrates how the two subcomponents can exert an
      influence on individual attitude beliefs.
