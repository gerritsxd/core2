    definition: The degree of likability of a image representing perceptions of typical
      persons engaging in or refraining from a certain behaviour.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'Prototype favourability can be assessed by rating adjectives relating
      to the prototype, for instance, how  "cool" or "likeable" the prototype is,
      and measuring responses on a 5- or 7-point Likert scale.


      For example: "How likeable or dislikeable do you think the type of person who
      drinks four units of alcohol (over the legal limit) and drives thereafter is?",
      with the scale anchors "Very likeable" and "Very dislikeable" (example from
      "Understanding young and older male drivers'' willingness to drive while intoxicated"
      by Rivis et al., 2011).


      Higher prototype favourability is assumed to be related to the increased likelihood
      that individuals will actually engage in the behaviour or will exhibit the willingness
      or intention to engage in the health-related behaviour associated with the prototype.

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.


      In this qualitative study, use the questions: "How would you describe the typical
      person that engages in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?" or "What is your image of the typical
      person that engages in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?"

      \ containing words such as \"smart/dumb\", \"attractive/unattractive\", and\
      \ \"desirable/undiserable\". \n\nThe words chosen to express the degree of (un)favourability\
      \ associated with the prototype in itself is also informative; i.e. it tells\
      \ us which association is most salient when refering to a prototype. For example,\
      \ indicating that a person wearing ear plugs when in a club is \"cool/uncool\"\
      \ and not saying that this particular person is \"smart/dumb\", may indicate\
      \ that \"coolness\" is an important factor (and likely more important than \"\
      smartness\") to assess the level of favourability with regard to the prototype.\
      \ \n\nExpressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of similarity, containing\
      \ verbs such as \"familiar/unfamiliar\",  \"related/unrelated\", \"resemble/differ\"\
