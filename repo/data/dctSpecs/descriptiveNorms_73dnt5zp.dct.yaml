  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Use likert scales that measure perceived behavior of important social\
      \ referents in general. It is important that no specific individuals are referenced,\
      \ but that the items do refer to individuals that are similar, important or\
      \ seen as important to follow. Note that the behavior in these items must always\
      \ be the target behavior. \n\nThe example items in the 2010 RAA book are \u2018\
      Most people I respect and admire will TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018\
      Unlikely\u2019 vs \u2018Likely\u2019; and \u2018How many people like you TARGET\
      \ BEHAVIOR?\u2019 with anchors \u2018Nobody\u2019 vs \u2018Everybody\u2019.\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived degree to\
      \ which important social referents in general perform or do not perform the\
      \ target behaviour.\n\nExamples of questions measuring descriptive norms (on\
      \ a 7-point Likert scale) are: \"\u2018Most people I respect and admire will\
      \ TARGET BEHAVIOUR\u2019 with anchors \u2018Unlikely\u2019 vs \u2018Likely\u2019\
      ; and \u2018How many people like you TARGET BEHAVIOUR?\u2019 with anchors \u2018\
      Nobody\u2019 vs \u2018Everybody\u2019.\n"
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,\
      \ and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept.\
      \ These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\n\
      In this qualitative study, use the introduction \u2018Sometimes, when we are\
      \ not sure what to do, we look to see what others are doing\u2019, and then\
      \ ask the question: \u2018Do persons important to you (engage in) TARGET BEHAVIOUR?'.\
      \ \n\nReference here is made to a 'generalized agent' (i.e. important social\
      \ referents in general) and no specific individuals are referenced. As reference\
      \ to a specific individual is often unavoidable, one may opt not to elicit construct\
      \ content with regard to descriptive norms, but limit the elicitation of construct\
      \ content to the subconstructs dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk and dct:referentIdentification_73dnt5zl.\n\
      \                                                                          \
      \                                                                          "
  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions of perceived behavior of others, i.e. whether others
      perform the target behavior or not, where it is unclear who exactly is the other
      or group that is referred to. If the social referent *is* clear, this should
      be coded as the underlying constructs: see dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk and
      dct:referentIdentification_73dnt5zl.


      Note that expressions of perceived approval or disapproval should be coded as
      dct:perceivedNorm_injunctive_73bg2wm7, and expressions of perceived norms where
      it is unclear whether they concern perceived (dis)approval or perceived approval
      should be coded as dct:perceivedNorm_71w98kk2.
