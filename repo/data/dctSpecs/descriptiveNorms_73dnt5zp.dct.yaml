      Descriptive norms refer to perceptions that others are or are not performing the behavior in question.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Use likert scales that measure perceived behavior of important social
      referents in general. It is important that no specific individuals are referenced,
      but that the items do refer to individuals that are similar, important or seen
      as important to follow. Note that the behavior in these items must always be
      the target behavior. \n\nThe example items in the 2010 RAA book are ‘Most people
      I respect and admire will TARGET BEHAVIOR.’ with anchors ‘Unlikely’ vs ‘Likely’;
      and ‘How many people like you TARGET BEHAVIOR?’ with anchors ‘Nobody’ vs ‘Everybody’.\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: |
      Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived degree to which important social referents in general perform or do not perform the target behaviour.

      Examples of questions measuring descriptive norms (on a 7-point Likert scale) are: "‘Most people I respect and admire will TARGET BEHAVIOUR’ with anchors ‘Unlikely’ vs ‘Likely’; and ‘How many people like you TARGET BEHAVIOUR?’ with anchors ‘Nobody’ vs ‘Everybody’.
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative
      study, use the introduction ‘Sometimes, when we are not sure what to do, we
      look to see what others are doing’, and then ask the question: ‘Do persons important
      to you (engage in) TARGET BEHAVIOUR?'. \n\nReference here is made to a 'generalized
      agent' (i.e. important social referents in general) and no specific individuals
      are referenced. As reference to a specific individual is often unavoidable,
      one may opt not to elicit construct content with regard to descriptive norms,
      but limit the elicitation of construct content to the subconstructs dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk
      and dct:referentIdentification_73dnt5zl.\n                                                                                                                                                    "
  aspect_code:
    instruction: |+
      Expressions of perceived behavior of others, i.e. whether others perform the target behavior or not, where it is unclear who exactly is the other or group that is referred to. If the social referent *is* clear, this should be coded as the underlying constructs: see dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk and dct:referentIdentification_73dnt5zl.

      Note that expressions of perceived approval or disapproval should be coded as dct:perceivedNorm_injunctive_73bg2wm7, and expressions of perceived norms where it is unclear whether they concern perceived (dis)approval or perceived approval should be coded as dct:perceivedNorm_71w98kk2.
