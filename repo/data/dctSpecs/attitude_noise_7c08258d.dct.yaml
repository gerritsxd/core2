  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Attitude towards noise is a specific subtype of attitude (see dct:\
      \ attitude_73dnt5zc). It is assessed with instruments that consist of  items\
      \ that measure both the experiential (see dct:experientialAttitude_73dnt5z5)\
      \ and instrumental (dct:instrumentalAttitude_73dnt5zb) attitude towards noise,\
      \ as is for example the case for the \u2018Youth Attitude to Noise Scale\u2019\
      \ (YANS) (Widen et al, 2006), or the instrument may measure attitude towards\
      \ loud sounds without the items being particularly experiential or instrumental\
      \ in nature.\n\nWhen \"attitude towards noise\" is assessed it is important\
      \ that this attitude is measured in diverse situations, i.e. the situations\
      \ must refer to both voluntarily and involuntarily chosen sources of loud noise\
      \ (e.g. both pop concerts and traffic noise). \n\n"

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are individually
      interviewed in a free-response format, and the interviews are either recorded
      and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction
      for aspect coding. In this qualitative study, use these three questions: ''What
      do you see as the advantages of LOUD SOUND'', ''What do you see as the disadvantages
      of LOUD SOUND?'' and ''What else comes to mind when you think about LOUD SOUND?''.


      To elicit the general attitude towards loud sound, diverse sources of loud sound
      and situations in which loud sound may be present, should be presented.

  aspect_code:
    instruction: "Expressions of any global evaluation of loud sound as a whole. Note\
      \ that evaluations of specific aspects or consequences of the behavior relate\
      \ to aspects of underlying constructs, not of attitude itself. \n\nExpressions\
      \ that relate specifically and only to attitudes towards loud sounds in sports,\
      \ musical, or nightlife settings are coded as dct:attitude_soundculture_7c082lmy\n\
