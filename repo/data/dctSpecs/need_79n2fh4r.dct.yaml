      An individual's perception whether an activity or situation satisfies an universal human need ( i.e. what is considered essential or necessary for well-being and healthy functioning).




  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Numerous self-report instruments exist to measure need satisfaction.
      These instruments measure the degree needs are satisfied in a particular domain
      (e.g. work, relationship), the degree needs are satisfied by a particular activity
      (e.g. a certain type of sports), or they assess need satisfaction in general.\n\nInstruments
      that measure need satisfaction most often assume that humans have universal
      needs. In particular, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and
      Maslow's (1968) Hierarchy of Needs have instigated the development of instruments
      to measure the satisfaction of these universal needs. The Basic Psychological
      Needs Scale (BPNS) (Gagné et al., 2003) and the Balanced Measure of Psychological
      Needs (BMPN) (Sheldon et al., 2012) measure needs from a SDT-perspective, while
      the Basic Need Satisfaction Inventory (BNSI) (Leidy et al., 1994)) adopts Maslow's
      standpoint on human needs.\n\nFor behaviour change (e.g. instigating healthy
      lifestyle choices), measuring general, as well as measuring domain- or activity-specific
      need satisfaction may have its merits. For example, Timmerman et al. (2001)
      found that the lower the level of basic need satisfaction, the more likely one
      is engaged in emotional eating. Need satisfaction at this general level, however,
      is harder to change than needs being met by specific activities or in a narrow
      domain. Therefore, instruments pertaining to the latter category are preferably
      used.\n\nNeed satisfaction can be asssessed by following a series of four steps:
      Firstly, depending on the theoretical background one adheres to (e.g. SDT) a
      list of of universal needs is composed. Secondly, to measure whether these needs
      are met by the situation or activity of interest, for each of these needs a
      number of items are used to assess the level of needs satisfaction. Thirdly,
      the item sumscores for each need, and the overall sumcore of all needs together
      are calculated. Fourth, the degree individual needs and all need together are
      satisfied by an activity or situation can be deduced from the two sumscores.
      \n\nNeed satisfaction in a particular domain can, for example, be assessed with
      the following sample items. These sample items pertain to the assessment of
      need satisfaction at work but (with slight adjustments) could also be used to
      measure need satisfaction in other domains or concerning specific activities.
      Participants are asked to indicate how true each statement is for them, with
      answer option ranging from \"Not at all true\" to \"Very true\" on a 7-point
      Likert scale: \"I feel like I can make a lot of inputs to deciding how my job
      gets done\", \"People at work care about me\", and \"Most days I feel a sense
      of accomplishment from working\". These three items reflect what SDT regards
      as the three basic human needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence.\n\n"

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative
      study, use the general  question: \"Do you feel your needs are being met by
      TARGET ACTIVITY/BEHAVIOUR?\"; or use a more narrow question to ask whether a
      specific universal need is met: \"Do you feel you have a connection with the
      people at work?\". The latter question is an example to assess whether \"relatedness\",
      one of the universal needs according to SDT, is met. \n\n\n\n"
  aspect_code:
    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply that needs are satisfied or
      not satisfied by the activity or behaviour of interest, for example: \"I feel
      like I can make a lot of inputs to deciding how my job gets done\", \"People
      at work do not care about me\", and \"Most days I feel a sense of accomplishment
      from working\". \n\nSelf-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci & Ryan, 1985) regards
      relatedness, autonomy, and competence as the three basic human needs. Therefore,
      expressions that indicate that autonomy and competence are regarded as important
      individual needs should be coded as dct:need_79n2fh4r and as, respectively,
      dct:autonomy_73dnt5zx and dct:capacity_73dnt602.\n\nIn a similar fashion, other
      expressions of needs may be given the coding dct:need_79n2fh4r and of another
      dct, e.g. dct:injunctiveNorms_73dnt5zj, if the participant expresses that approval
      of people around him/her of his/her behaviour is regarded as an important individual
      need."
