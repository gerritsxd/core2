    definition: "A person's belief that important individuals or groups in his/her\
      \ life perform or don\u2019t perform a particular behavior."
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "The measurement of descriptive norm beliefs starts with an elicitation\
      \ study to identify the content of descriptive norm beliefs about the behaviour\
      \ which are shared by the target population. \n\nTo obtain quantitative data\
      \ regarding descriptive norm beliefs, the participant is subsequently asked\
      \ to respond to two questions with respect to each salient descriptive norm\
      \ belief, one to assess the perceived behaviour of a given social referent (dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk)\
      \ and the other to measure the identification with that social referent  (dct:referentIdentification_73dnt5zl).\
      \ \n\nFinally, to get a total quantitative score of a descriptive norm belief,\
      \ the perceived behaviour of a social referent is multiplied by the identification\
      \ with that social referent . The total score of a descriptive norm belief enables\
      \ the assessment of the importance of the contribution of a descriptive norm\
      \ belief, in comparison with other descriptive norm beliefs, to the descriptive\
      \ norm beliefs composite (dct:descrNorms_belCom_73dnt5zn).\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Each descriptive norm belief is the product term of the multiplication\
      \ of the perceived behaviour of a given social referent (dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk)\
      \ by the identification with that social referent  (dct:referentIdentification_73dnt5zl).\
      \  \n\nTherefore, whether an descriptive norm belief exerts influence (and if\
      \ so, to what extent) on the descriptive norm beliefs composite (dct:descrNorms_belCom_73dnt5zn),\
      \ and whether a particular descriptive norm belief lowers or increases the perception\
      \ that salient normative referents are performing the behaviour in question,\
      \ can only be deduced by concurrent consultation of the two subcomponents of\
      \ which it is constructed. Table 4.1 on p. 136 of the Reasoned Action Approach\
      \ book (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010)  provides an example how the subcomponents exert\
      \ an influence on individual normative beliefs (in Table 4.1 it concerns injunctive\
      \ normative beliefs).\n"

    instruction: 'Descriptive norm beliefs can not be directly elicited. They are
      the product of a participant''s perception of a normative referent''s conduct
      of the target behaviour multiplied by the degree a participant wants to be like
      that normative referent with regards to the target behaviour
