  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'Use 5- or 7-point Likert scales that measure the severity of the
      (health) threat in question, e.g. " I believe that HEALTH THREAT is severe"
      and "I believe that HEALTH THREAT has serious negative consequences" with "Strongly
      disagree" and "Strongly agree" as anchors.


      Examples of items measuring the perceived severity of a health threat are: "I
      believe that HIV infection has serious negative consequences" and "I believe
      that HIV infection is extremely harmful", with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly
      agree" as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale (examples are from the Risk Behaviour
      Diagnosis Scale [Witte et al., 1995]).

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,
      and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These
      sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.


      In this qualitative study, use the questions: "How would you rate the risk associated
      with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?" or "Can you describe your personal
      ideas of the risk associated with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?".

    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of perceived threat\
      \ severity, containing verbs such as \"very/not very severe\",  \"malicious/benign\"\
      , and \"great disturbance\"/\"minor annoyance\".\n\nExpressions that demonstrate\
      \ or imply the degree of perceived threat susceptibility, containing phrases\
      \ and words such as \"high/low risk\", \"high/low prevalence\", \"likely/unlikely\"\
      , \"nobody I know\"/\"a lot of people I know\" (the latter two responses refering\

      \ For example, if the question is \"Can you describe your personal ideas of\
      \ the risk associated with smoking cigarettes?\" and the response is \"I know\

      \ no clear reference is made to to the severity of the threat or to personal\
      \ susceptibility.\n"
