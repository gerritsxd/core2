      A person's belief about the extent to which performance or nonperformance of a particular behaviour is up to him/her.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "The measurement of autonomy beliefs starts with an elicitation study
      to identify the content of autonomy beliefs about the behaviour which are shared
      by the target population. \n\nTo obtain quantitative data regarding autonomy
      beliefs, the participant is subsequently asked to respond to two questions with
      respect to each autonomy belief, one to assess autonomy belief strength (see
      dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) and the other to measure the power
      of the autonomy belief to facilitate or impede behavioural performance (see
      dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs). \n\nFinally, to get an overall quantitative
      score of an autonomy belief, the strength of a belief is multiplied by its perceived
      power. The total score of an autonomy belief enables the assessment of the importance
      of the contribution of an autonomy belief, in comparison with other autonomy
      beliefs, to the autonomy beliefs composite (see dct:autonomy_belCom_73dnt5zw
      ).\n"

      Each autonomy belief is the product term of the multiplication of the strength of the belief (see dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) by its perceived power (see dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs). Therefore, whether an autonomy belief exerts influence (and if so, to what extent) on the autonomy beliefs composite (see dct:autonomy_belCom_73dnt5zw ), and whether a particular autonomy belief lowers or increases the sense of perceived autonomy, can only be deduced by concurrent consultation of the two subcomponents of which it is constructed. Table 5.5 on p. 171 of the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) book (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010) illustrates how the two subcomponents can exert an influence on individual autonomy beliefs.

    instruction: |
      Autonomy beliefs can not be directly elicited. They are the product of the multiplication of the strength of the autonomy belief (see dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) by its perceived power (see dct:autonomy_conditionPower_73dnt5zs). See these two subconstructs for instructions for eliciting their respective construct content.
