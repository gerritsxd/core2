    definition: "\nPeople\u2019s perceptions of their ability to perform a behavior;\
      \ that is, the degree to which they believe they can, are able to, or are capable\
      \ of performing the behavior."
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Use Likert scales that measure the degree to which participants\
      \ believe the target behavior to be something they are capable of performing\
      \ successfully. The items suggested in the book are: \u2018I am confident that\
      \ if I want to, I can TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018No confidence\
      \ at all\u2019 vs \u2018A lot of confidence\u2019 and \u2018If I really wanted\
      \ to, I could TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018Unlikely\u2019 vs \u2018\
      Likely\u2019.\n\nNote that questions about how easy or difficult participants\
      \ perceive a target behavior to be fall outside of the constructs of Perceived\
      \ Behavioral Control, Autonomy, and Capacity as defined in the 2010 RAA book."
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived degree to\
      \ which target behavior or [contrast behavior] is something [target population]\
      \ are confident they can successfully perform. If perceived control over the\
      \ behavior is also measured, code this as dct:perceivedBehavioralControl_71w8sfdk.\
      \ For example, the items suggested in the book are: \u2018I am confident that\
      \ if I want to, I can TARGET BEHAVIOR.\u2019 with anchors \u2018No confidence\
      \ at all\u2019 vs \u2018A lot of confidence\u2019 and \u2018If I really wanted\

    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,\
      \ and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept.\
      \ These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.\n\n\
      In this qualitative study, use these two questions. \u2018Please list any factors\
      \ or circumstances that would make it easy or enable you to target behavior.\u2019\

    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence or absence of\
      \ confidence about one\u2019s ability to perform the target behavior. Expressions\
      \ that refer to explicit control over the target behavior (or lack thereof),\
      \ for example because of a barrier, obstacle, or facilitating condition or circumstance,\
      \ it should be coded as perceivedBehavioralControl_autonomy_73bg9sq6. Expressions\
