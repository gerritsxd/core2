    instruction: "Use Likert scales that measure the degree to which participants\
      \ are temped by a situation or stimulus to carry out the behaviour of interest.\
      \ For example, participants are asked to indicate if they are temped to take\
      \ drugs in the following situations: \"When I am feeling depressed\", \"When\
      \ I am being offered drugs in a social situation\", \"When I am physically tired\"\
      , \"When I see others using drugs at a bar or a party\" with responses \"Not\
      \ at all\", \"Not very\", \"Moderately\", \"Very\", and \"Extremely\" for each\
      \ item on a 5-point Likert scale. The sample items are from the Temptation to\
      \ Use Drugs Scale (Di Clemente et al., 1994).\n\nAnother example is provided\
      \ by Lazuras et al. (2010). They measured the situational tempation among athletes\
      \ to use doping substances with the stem proposition \u201CHow much would you\
      \ be tempted to use prohibited doping substances to enhance your performance\
      \ this season,\u201D followed by four items reflecting temptations to use prohibited\
      \ performance-enhancing substances under different circumstances that potentially\
      \ induce normative influence (\u201Cwhen your coach suggests so,\u201D \u201C\
      when you believe that most colleagues of yours use prohibited substances,\u201D\
      \ \u201Cwhen you were told to enhance your performance,\u201D and \u201Cwhen\
      \ you prepare for an important game/competition\u201D). Responses were recorded\
      \ on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all tempted, 5 = very much tempted).\n\
      \nNote that the instructions and examples given above apply to the measurement\
      \ of situational temptation. For the measurement of the susceptibility to tempations\
      \ in general (i.e. assessing the presence of a personality trait as the causal\
      \ factor) other instructions and instruments apply, e.g. the Susceptibility\
      \ to Temptation Scale can be used."

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed,\
      \ and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept.\
      \ These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding. \n\n\
      In this qualitative study, use this questions: \"What situations or circumstances\
      \ create a desire to perform PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR?\"\n\nFor example, \"What situations\
      \ or circumstances create a desire to drink alcohol?\"\n"
  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions that describe situations or circumstances that arouse
      a desire to engage in the behaviour of interest, e.g. expressions such as "when
      I see somebody drink a beer it is impossible to resist" and "when I see that
      a bike is not locked, I can not walk by without taking it with me".


      Expressions that describe a susceptibility to temptations in general (i.e. not
      refering to situations or circumstances but to a personality trait as causal
      factor), do not describe dct:temptation_79n2fh4w and should not be coded as
      such.
