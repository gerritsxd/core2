    definition: '

      A person''s belief about the degree to which he/she can, is able to, or is capable
      of performing a particular behavior.'
  measure_dev:
    instruction: "The measurement of capacity beliefs starts with an elicitation study\
      \ to identify the content of capacity beliefs about the behaviour which are\
      \ shared by the target population. \n\nTo obtain quantitative data regarding\
      \ capacity beliefs, the participant is subsequently asked to respond to two\
      \ questions with respect to each salient capacity belief, one question to assess\
      \ the perceived likelihood that the capacity will be present (see dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy),\
      \ and the other to measure the perceived importance of the capacity to facilitate\
      \ or impede behavioral performance (see dct:capacity_subskillImportance_73dnt5zz).\n\
      \nFinally, to get a total quantitative score of a capacity belief, the perceived\
      \ presence of a capacity is multiplied by its perceived importance. The total\
      \ score of a capacity belief enables the assessment of the importance of the\
      \ contribution of a capacity belief, in comparison with other capacity beliefs,\
      \ to the capacity beliefs composite (see dct:capacity_belCom_73dnt601).  \n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Each capacity belief is the product term of the multiplication of\
      \ the perceived presence of a capacity (i.e. 'subskill') (see dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy)\
      \ by its perceived importance (see dct:capacity_subskillImportance_73dnt5zz).\
      \ \n\nTherefore, whether an capacity belief exerts influence (and if so, to\
      \ what extent) on the capacity beliefs composite (see dct:capacity_belCom_73dnt601),\
      \ and whether a particular capacity belief lowers or increases the sense of\
      \ perceived capacity, can only be deduced by concurrent consultation of the\
      \ two subcomponents of which it is constructed. Table 5.5 on p. 171 of the Reasoned\
      \ Action Approach (RAA) book (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010) provides an example how\
      \ the subcomponents exert an influence on individual control beliefs (in Table\
      \ 5.5 it concerns autonomy beliefs)."
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'Capacity beliefs can not be directly elicited. They are the product
      of the multiplication of perceived subskill presence (dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy)
      by the perceived  importance of this subskill (dct:capacity_subskillImportance_73dnt5zz).
      See these two subconstructs for instructions for eliciting their respective
      construct content.
