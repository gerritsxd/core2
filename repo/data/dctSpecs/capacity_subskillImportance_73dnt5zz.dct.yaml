    definition: 'The perceived importance of a subskill refers to how important possessing
      the subskill is to successfully accomplishing the target behavior. A subskill
      can be perceived to anything from completely irrelevant to crucial. Note that
      the perception of whether one possesses a subskills is its perceived presence
      (dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy).


      According to the Reasoned Action Approach, perceptions about the importance
      of subskills combine multiplicatively with perceptions about the presence of
      subskills (see dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy) into capacity beliefs
      (see dct:capacity_belief_73dnt600).


      Examples of perceived subskill importance are the perception that to successfully
      buy condoms, it is vital one possesses the skill to ask for condoms at the counter;
      the perception that to successfully moderate one''s alcohol intake, it doesn''t
      really matter whether one possesses the skill to decline an alcoholic drink
      when it is offered; the perception that to successfully run 5 kilometers, it
      is a prerequisite that one is able to run 5 kilometers; the perception that
      to protect one''s hearing from loud sounds, it helps if one is able to insert
      earplugs into one''s ear canal properly; and the perception that to prevent
      skin cancer in one''s child, it doesn''t matter whether one knows how to apply
      sunscreen on a child.'

    instruction: 'The perceived importance of a subskill is measured by asking the
      extent to which possessing the subskill is relevant to performance of the behavior.
      The items are formulated as ''For me to successfully [BEHAVIOR], being able
      to [SUBSKILL] is...'' with ''Not at all important'' and ''extremely important''
      as anchors.


      For example, ''For me to successfully use condoms, being able to ask for condoms
      at the counter is [not at all important|extremely important],'' ''For me to
      successfully moderate my alcohol intake, being able to decline an alcoholic
      drink when it is offered is [not at all important|extremely important].'''
