      The overall presence or absence of action plans for the target behaviour. In its totality, the action plan composite indicates the likelihood of performance of the target behaviour.

      Action plans (see dct:action_plan_79n2w1bh) are detailed plans to perform a distinct subbehaviour of the target behaviour. Action plans direct when, where, and how to carry out this subbehaviour or integrated set of component subbehaviours. If the target behaviour is defined at a very high level of specificity, the action plan may also concern performance of the target behaviour itself.

      The presence of a greater number of action plans (i.e. an action plan for each of the subbehaviours that together constitute the target behaviour), and greater level of detail of action plans (i.e. specifying exactly when, where, and how to carry out the subbehaviours) increase the likelihood of performance of the target behaviour. The extent to which the various action plans related to the target behaviour are present or absent, is represented by the action plan composite.

      A composite of action plans is obtained by summing present and absent action plans for the target behaviour. The subsequent approach can thereby be followed:

      1) Break downs the target behaviour in subbehaviours.
      2) Formulate items measuring the presence of action plans for each of these subbehaviours (see dct:action_plan_79n2w1bh for instructions).
      3) Create action plan composite: sum all present (=1) and absent (=0) action plans for the target behaviour

      Participants' overall score expresses the degree action plans for the subbehaviours are present. A high score (e.g. 6 out of 7) makes performance of the target behaviour more likely.
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Action plans composites represent the degree action plans are present
      or absent for the target behaviour. In research, such an overall overview, either
      graphically or numerically represented, is generally absent. \n\nTherefore,
      action plans composites have to be deduced from the scores on the different
      action plan items. One way of doing is, is by creating an overall score by summing
      the scores of all items measuring action plans (see \"measure_dev\" for instruction
      for dichotomous scored items). \n\nParticipants' overall score expresses the
      degree action plans for the subbehaviours are present. A high score (e.g. 6
      out of 7) makes performance of the target behaviour more likely."
