  measure_dev:
    instruction: "Items to measure autonomy usually ask participants to consider the\
      \ extent to which extent performance or nonperformance of the behaviour is under\
      \ their control or is up to them. The focus here is on control over performance\
      \ as well as nonperformance of the behaviour. \n\nFishbein & Ajzen provide a\
      \ sample question to measure autonomy on p. 450 of their Reasoned Action Approach\
      \ (RAA) book (2010): \"My exercising for at least 20 minutes, three times per\
      \ week, for the next 3 months is up to me\". Answer options range from \"Disagree\"\
      \ to \"Agree\" on a 7-point Likert scale. \n\nOther examples of items that measure\
      \ autonomy are (p. 166 of RAA book): \"How much control do you have over whether\
      \ you perform behavior x?\" (no control\u2013complete control); \"I feel in\
      \ complete control over whether I perform behavior x\" (completely false\u2013\
      completely true); \"Whether or not I perform behavior x is completely up to\
      \ me\" (disagree\u2013agree); \"How much do you feel that performing behavior\
      \ x is beyond your control?\" (not at all\u2013very much); \"It is mostly up\
      \ to me whether or not I perform behavior x\" (strongly agree\u2013strongly\
      \ disagree); \"The number of events outside my control which could prevent me\
      \ from performing behavior x are ...\" (numerous\u2013very few).\n"
  measure_code:
    instruction: "Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived degree to\
      \ which performance or nonperformance of the behaviour is under participants'\
      \ control or is up to them. Examples of questions measuring autonomy are: \"\
      I feel in complete control over whether I perform TARGET BEHAVIOUR\" (completely\
      \ false\u2013completely true); and \"Whether or not I perform TARGET BEHAVIOUR\
      \ is completely up to me\", with responses ranging from \"Disagree\" to \"Agree\"\
      \ on a 7-point Likert scale.\n"
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are individually\
      \ interviewed in a free-response format, and the interviews are either recorded\
      \ and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the\
      \ instruction for aspect coding.\n\nIn this qualitative study, use these two\
      \ questions: \u2018Please list any factors or circumstances that would make\
      \ it easy or enable you to TARGET BEHAVIOUR\u2019 and \u2018Please list any\
      \ factors or circumstances that would make it difficult or prevent you from\
      \ TARGET BEHAVIOUR.\u2019"
  aspect_code:
    instruction: "Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence or absence of\
      \ confidence about one\u2019s control over performance or nonperformance of\
      \ the target behaviour (i.e. if (non)performance is \"up to them\"), for example\
      \ because of a barrier, obstacle, or facilitating condition or circumstance.\
      \ \n\nExpressions that relate to one\u2019s ability to perform the target behavior,\
      \ should be coded as dct:capacity_73dnt602.\n\nExpressions that refer to control\
      \ in general (not specifically one\u2019s autonomy), should be coded as dct:perceivedBehavioralControl_71w8sfdk.\n"
