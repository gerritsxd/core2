  definition:
    definition: 'Motivation to comply with a specific social referent refers to an
      individual''s motivation to behave in a way that is most approved of by that
      social referent. Note that motivation to comply is separate from the approval
      or disapproval itself, which is captured in dct:referentApproval_73dnt5zd.


      A social referent can be a specific individual, a group of distinct individuals
      (e.g. one''s siblings), or a more generically defined group (e.g. the residents
      of my city).


      The motivation to comply with a given social referent combines multiplicatively
      with the perceived approval of that referent (dct:referentApproval_73dnt5zd)
      into an injunctive norm belief (dct:injNorms_belief_73dnt5zg).'

    instruction: "To measure the motivation to comply with a given social referent,\
      \ measure how much people want to do what the relevant social referents think\
      \ they should do with regard to the target behavior.\n\nIn most behaviors and\
      \ populations, unidimensional scales can be used. As item stem, use 'When it\
      \ comes to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], I want to do what [SOCIAL REFERENT] think(s) I\
      \ should do.', and as anchors, 'Not at all' and 'Very much'. For example, 'When\
      \ it comes to whether I avoid meat during dinner, I want to do what my partner\
      \ thinks I should do. ['Not at all'|'Very much']' or 'When it comes to my coffee\
      \ consumption, I want to do what my colleagues think I should do. ['Not at all'|'Very\
      \ much']'.\n\nHowever, for some behaviors and some populations, it's not only\
      \ possible that individuals want to do what a social referent thinks they should\
      \ do to a certain degree, but it's also possible that the individual actively\
      \ wants to do what that social referent would *disapprove* of. For example,\
      \ people may strongly want to clearly demonstrate distancing themselves from\
      \ members of a perceived outgroup (e.g. adolescents may want to disobey middle-aged\
      \ people).\n\nIn such situations, you can use a bidimensional scale to account\
      \ for this variation. Use item stem 'When it comes to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], I want\
      \ to do what [SOCIAL REFERENT]...' with anchors 'Do(es)n't want me to do' and\
      \ 'Want(s) me to do'. For example, 'When it comes to condom use with a partner,\
      \ I want to do what other adolescents... [Don\u2019t want me to do|Want me to\
      \ do]', or 'When it comes to how late I go to bed, I want to do what my older\
      \ sibling ... [Doesn\u2019t want me to do|Wants me to do]'"
