    definition: "A latent disposition or tendency to respond with some degree of favorableness\
      \ or unfavorableness to the target behavior based on the perceived usefulness\
      \ of engaging in that target behavior to achieving one\u2019s goals.\n"

      \ a generally desirable instrumental state/goal and the left-most anchor expresses\
