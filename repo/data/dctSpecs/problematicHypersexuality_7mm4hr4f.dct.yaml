  definition:
    definition: "Problematic Hypersexuality (PH) is defined as the experience of distress\
      \ and negative consequences due to hypersexual urges and behavior - to the extent\
      \ that the experience of PH causes the individual to at least consider seeking\
      \ help. The construct of PH we base on the common and unique criteria (ten in\
      \ total) found in three perspectives on PH.\n\n---- Before we present these\
      \ ten criteria we distilled from the three perspectives, we note that the three\
      \ perspectives come as diagnostic systems, while our definition of PH must be\
      \ taken as a construct definition for research. This means, among others, that\
      \ what are called 'criteria' within the diagnostic systems, we call 'characteristics'.\
      \ With this Decentralized Construct Taxonomy (DCT) definition on PH we hope\
      \ to define as clearly as possible what we mean by PH in our studies (references\
      \ to the studies using this definition can be found under 'Comments'). As our\
      \ research progresses, the DCT definition of PH might change. Also, others might\
      \ use other but similar constructs that can be equally valid, if made explicit.\
      \ Current research practices often suffer from hidden heterogeneity: definitions\
      \ are not made explicit or are imprecise. Often constructs that bear the same\
      \ name, prove to differ in small but important details. Reasons to adhere to\
      \ explicit heterogeneity in definitions of constructs are explained in more\
      \ detail here: (Peters & Crutzen, 2022, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8tpcv).\n\
      \n---- We now return to the DCT definition of PH. The three diagnostic perspectives\
      \ on PH we make use of, are: 1) Sex addiction; 2) Hypersexual Disorder; and\
      \ 3) Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder. The ten characteristics of PH we apply\
      \ in this DCT of PH are based on 6 overlapping criteria and 4 unique criteria\
      \ for PH retrieved from these three perspectives. The 6 overlapping criteria\
      \ for PH we retrieved, are: 1) Intense focus on and preoccupation with sex;\
      \ 2) Repetitive sexual acitivities leading to neglect of selfcare and responsibilities;\
      \ 3) Negative consequences in one or more life domains; 4) Disregard of risk\
      \ of harm to self or others: 5) Failed attempts to stop the sexual behavior;\
      \ and 6) Continue PH behavior despite negative consequences. From the 'sex addiction'\
      \ perspective we retrieved the following criteria: 7) Tolerance (the need to\
      \ increase sexual intenstiy of frequency); and 8) Withdrawal symptoms (e.g.\
      \ restlessness). From the 'hypersexual disorder' perspective we retrieved: 9)\
      \ Sex used to cope with dysphoric mood states or stressful life events. From\
      \ the 'compulsive sexual behavior disorder' perspective we retrieved: 10) Continue\
      \ PH behavior despite loss of pleasure in sex.  These ten potentially cue valid\
      \ characteristics of PH we consider as more permanent and relatively stable.\
      \ With cue valid we mean: to a greater or lesser degree uniquely pertaining\
      \ to hypersexuality. IRT validation studies can decide on the importance of\
      \ each of these characteristics in assessing PH and are able to assess cue validity\
      \ when relevant subpopulations are included in research. Furthermore, we consider\
      \ PH to be ruled by two drivers: 1) high sexual desire; and 2) emotion dysregulation\
      \ with regard to sexuality (Kingston, 2018; specifies these drivers as 'dimensions').\
      \ These two drivers we see as necessary for PH to occur but not as sufficient\
      \ for PH to be the case. The ten characteristics are connected to the two drivers\
      \ as outcomes are connected to processes. The process in PH that is maintained\
      \ by the two drivers is that of a vicious circle- we hypothesize. Negative feelings\
      \ (e.g. shame) lead to sexually acting out in order to cope with them. The sexual\
      \ acting out reinforces shame, thus increasing the risk of a new cycle of shame\
      \ and sexual acting out. Our investigations of this vicious circle is underway\
      \ but at the time not conclusive. Therefore, this DCT of PH should be considered\
      \ as preliminary and open to change. If a vicious circle for PH is not confirmed\
      \ - or even disconfirmed - this will lead to a different DCT for PH. If a vicious\
      \ circle is confirmed, this might lead to a more detailed description of its\
      \ nature, and this too will lead to an adaptation of this DCT for PH.\n\n----\
      \ To conclude this definition: we consider Problematic Hypersexuality as delineated\
      \ from Non-problematic Hypersexuality (NH). By NH we mean the experience of\
      \ hypersexuality without enduring distress or negative consequences. Hypersexuality\
      \ in general - in short defined as taking great interest in experiencing sexuality\
      \ - is the overarching concept, binding NH and PH together. In the future both\
      \ NH and Hypersexuality might be awarded their own DCT.\n\n---- We offer the\
      \ following figure as an overview of this DCT definition of PH and note that\
      \ cue valid characteristics are best established using IRT validation, while\
      \ measuring driving processes of PH can best be done using ESM techniques: https://osf.io/89ha7\n\
      Both research methodologies (IRT and ESM) will profit from comparing a PH populations\
      \ with relevant other populations and we suggest to consider an NH population\
      \ for this purpose.\n\n-----Studies using this DCT of PH are currently under\
      \ review or are being developed (January 2023).\n\n----References:\n\n----Kingston\

  measure_dev:
    instruction: '1) One-off measurement instruments - Currently, there are a number
      of one-off measurement instruments available that either measure sex addiction,
      hypersexual disorder or compulsive sexual behavior disorder. These questionnaires
      reflect one specific perspective on PH. In line with our DCT definition for
      PH, we intend to combine a number of these questionnaires into one instrument.
      For this we need to investigate which items predict best if someone is afflicted
      by PH. This study is now (January 2023) underway. Previous validation research
      for PH did not involve Item Response Theory techniques. We make use of IRT to
      make the best selection of cue valid items from the different measurement instruments
      for PH. These items and instruments have been developed within the three perspectives
      on PH (sex addiction, hypersexual disorder, compulsive sexual behavior disorder).
      IRT might help to decide on what characteristics best define PH.


      2) Dynamical assessment - As specified in the definition, we see PH as driven
      by high sexual desire in combination with emotion dysregulation. These dynamical
      and fluctuating processes involved in PH we see as underlying the more permanent
      outcomes (each of the ten characteristics of PH). Experience Sampling Method
      (ESM) techniques are most optimal to assess these processes, as ESM is an ecologically
      valid method that is capable to assess fluctuations in sexual desire and emotions
      and link these to sexual activity in temporal analyses. Currently, a number
      of items are involved in measuring sexual desire and emotions with ESM techniques.
      Response Process Evaluations (Wolf et al., 2019) of these items needs to be
      undertaken still.'
  measure_code:
    instruction: For literature reviews no instructions for coding measurement instruments
      are given as this construct definition of PH is new. It might be investigated
      in a literature review as either sexual addiction, hypersexual disorder or compulsive
      sexual behavior disorde. All three perspectives shed light on a particular aspect
      of PH. Therefore, at this moment, a literature review on PH should rather consider
      the three perspectives on PH separately or in combination, to investigate previous
      studies on subjects related to PH.
  aspect_dev:
    instruction: 'For different subpopulations instructions to elicit content will
      be different. In a qualitative study on chemsex participation, currently being
      developed, we will elicit construct content using the following coding structure
      https://osf.io/s843n


      We note that the vicious circle hypothesized for PH in general - as described
      in this DCT definition for PH - is an integral part of the coding structure.
      For other groups (e.g. NH and PH pornusers), a similar coding structure for
      PH (in  presented in blue block) will be used, also including a vicious circle.
      However, the overall structure will be different, as pornuse and chemsex generally
      take place in very different settings (and this setting or context is part of
      the coding structure as well, as is exemplified in the a priori coding structure
      for the chemsex study).'
  aspect_code:
    instruction: Construct content will be coded at first as separate themes, following
      the a priori coding structure for PH chemsex participation (in case of the chemsex
      study). This coding scheme already provides a potential network structure in
      which certain aspects of chemsex experiences can be more prominently linked
      to characteristics of PH than others. Such connections will be subsumed under
      new themes by axial coding. Then, attention can be given to the more prominently
      visible and nuanced aspects by assigning childcodes to them.
