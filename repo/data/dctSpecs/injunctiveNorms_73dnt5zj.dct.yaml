  definition:
    definition: 'Injunctive norms refer to perceptions concerning what should or ought
      to be done with respect to performing a given behaviour. People may be motivated
      to behave in accordance with what they believe others think they should do (injunctive
      norms) because the social agent has the power to reward or punish them, because
      the agent has the right to request it, because the agent is an expert, or because
      they want to be like the agent. The operation of reward, coercive, and legitimate
      power all imply that the social agent expects a particular kind of behavior;
      that is, it implies an injunctive norm.

      Note that expressions of perceived performance of the target behaviour by others
      should be coded as dct:descriptiveNorms_73dnt5zp, and expressions of perceived

      approval should be coded as dct:perceivedNorm_71w98kk2.
