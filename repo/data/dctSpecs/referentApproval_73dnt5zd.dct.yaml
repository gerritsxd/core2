    definition: 'The perceived approval or disapproval of a social referent refers
      to whether a given individual believes that social referent thinks that that
      given individual should engage in the target behavior. Note that this concerns
      whether the *individual* should engage in the target behavior, not whether the
      social referent themselves should engage in the target behavior. Also note that
      this is distinct from whether the social referent themselves does actually engage
      in the target behavior, which is captured in dct:referentBehavior_73dnt5zk.


      A social referent can be a specific individual, a group of distinct individuals
      (e.g. one''s siblings), or a more generically defined group (e.g. the residents
      of my city).


      The perceived approval for a given social referent combines multiplicatively
      with the motivation to comply with that referent (dct:motivationToComply_73dnt5zf)
      into an injunctive norm belief (dct:injNorms_belief_73dnt5zg).'

    instruction: 'Use item stems that list the target behavior and the social referent,
      and use disapproval and approval as anchors, in that order, with an intensifying
      adjective. Specifically, as item stem, use ''If I were to (engage in) [TARGET
      BEHAVIOR], [SOCIAL REFERENT] would...'' with anchors ''strongly disapprove''
      versus ''strongly approve''. Note that the ''engage in'' is optional, depending
      on the kind of behavior. For example, ''If I were to engage in a demonstration,
      my neighbour would... [Strongly disapprove|Strongly approve]''


      Because this is a bidimensional scale, the scale midpoint reflects neutrality
      (i.e. one does not think the relevant social referent disapproves or approves
      of this target behavior. This means that a seven-point response scale is slightly
      preferred over a five-point response scale to allow participants to express
      three degrees of perceived (dis)approval.'
