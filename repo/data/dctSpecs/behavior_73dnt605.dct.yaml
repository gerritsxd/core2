  definition:
    definition: The target behaviour is the behaviour to explain using determinants.
      A behaviour is defined as individual human activity that involves co-ordinated
      contraction of striated muscles controlled by the brain. Note that this also
      includes the lack of such co-ordinated contraction.
  measure_dev:
    instruction: 'Depending on the nature of the target behavior, engagement in that
      behavior can be conceived as binary (i.e. one either does or does not engage
      in the target behavior, e.g. getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter
      of frequency (i.e. one engages in the target behavior with a frequency from
      zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g. the
      frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter
      of intensity (i.e. one engages in the target behavior to a degree from zero
      up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g. the amount of kilocalories one
      consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e. one engages in the target
      behavior with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g. how frequently
      one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).

  measure_code:
    instruction: 'Ideally, the target behaviour is described unequivocally and consistent
      in the questions and instructions for participants, and in publications resulting
      from the research. Moreover, the target behaviour should be described as specific
      as possible, i.e. specifying action, target, context, and time - and address
      the level of generality of the behaviour. Diverging and/or ambiguous formulations
      of the target behaviour confound and limit the applicability of study results.


      For example ''exercising for at least 20 minutes, three times per week, for
      the next 3 months'' could be a viable target behaviour. However, the definition
      of ''exercising'' should specified, as participants be may have different views
      of what comprises ''exercising''. When a target behaviour is not sufficiently
      defined, or when various definitions are used, this has to be taken into account
      when assessing the quality of the study.

  aspect_dev:
    instruction: "Conduct a qualitative study where participants are individually\
      \ interviewed in a free-response format, and the interviews are either recorded\
      \ and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the\
      \ instruction for aspect coding. In this qualitative study, ask participants\
      \ for their performance of the target behaviour. The target behaviour should\
      \ be described unequivocally and consistent, addressing action, target, context,\
      \ time, and level of generality. As an introduction to the question a definition\
      \ of the target behaviour can be provided. \n\nAn example can be: 'Our definition\
      \ of \"exercise\" is \"all physical activity strenuous enough to make you sweat\"\
      . Can you tell me if you currently exercise for at least 20 minutes, three times\
      \ per week?'. An alternative question could be: 'In the past 3 months, how often\
      \ have you exercised for at least 20 minutes, three times per week?'. Note that\
      \ this latter question measures past behaviour. In practice, asking about current\
      \ behaviour most often concerns a retrospective asessment of behaviour until\
      \ the moment of assessment.\n"
  aspect_code:
    instruction: 'Expressions that demonstrate or imply engagement in the target behaviour.
      The more specific the definition of the target behaviour, the greater the possibility
      that people partially engage in the target behaviour; i.e. they do not fulfill
      all behavioural criteria, e.g. when a participant exercises for at least 20
      minutes, but not three, but two times per week. How these partial engagements
      in the target behaviour are to be coded, should be decided a priori.
