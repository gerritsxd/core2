## Definition

Peopleâ€™s perceptions of the consistency or inconsistency between their perceived behaviour and a given guideline.

## Developing Measurement Instruments

Awareness, in the present definition, is the agreement between self-rated behaviour and a given behavioural guideline. The construct can be assessed in a three-step procedure:

1) Firstly, participants are asked if their behaviour is in line with with the guidelines for that particular behaviour (yes/no). If the guideline is not known, in an introduction to the question this information is provided.

2) Secondly, participants' actual engagement in the target behaviour is assessed using objective measures (e.g. accelerometer and heart rate monitor to measure actual physical activity, caloric calculations to measure food intake).

3) Thirdly, the accuracy of participants' perception of their behaviour meeting the guidelines can be assessed by comparing the outcomes of step 1 and 2. As a result of this comparison, four awareness groups can be created: overestimators, underestimators, realistic (not meeting guideline), and realistic (meeting guideline). Thus, the latter two groups are aware of their behaviour, while the first two groups are not.

See "Awareness of physical activity in healthy middle-aged adults: a cross-sectional study of associations with sociodemographic, biological, behavioural, and psychological factors" (Godino et al., 2014) for a sample application of this method.


## Coding Measurement Instruments

People's perception of their behaviour meeting a guideline (yes/no) compared with an objective assessment of this particular behaviour can be employed as a measure of awareness.

People's perception of their behaviour meeting a guideline can be asssessed with a single question, with yes/no response options.

Objective measures of behaviour are observation and/or the tracking/monitoring of behaviour with mobile apps and technical devices such as accelerometers. If no objective assessment of behaviour can be made, participants can be asked a series of very specific questions concering the target behaviour or asked to keep a diary. These outcomes are subsequently compared with participants' perception of their behaviour meeting the guideline.  


## Eliciting Construct Content (Qualitative Research)

Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.

In this qualitative study, introduce a specific guideline (for example for physical activity, the number of calories needed a day, or the maximum safe exposure to loud noise in decibels/minutes a day), followed by the following consecutive questions "Do you meet this guideline?" and "Why do you think you meet/do not meet the guideline?" 


## Coding Qualitative Data

Expressions that demonstrate or imply the ability to correctly evaluate one's behaviour in light of the guideline (i.e. "awareness"). For example: "I don't do sports, I do not do any physical work, I travel by car, so I am pretty sure I don't get the recommended level of activity" or "I weigh all my food and use an app to calculate the number of calories, so I know my food intake is in line with the energetic recommendations for my age, bodyweight, and activity level".
