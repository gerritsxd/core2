## Definition

Beliefs about oneâ€™s risk of experiencing the threat.

## Developing Measurement Instruments

Use 5- or 7-point Likert scales that measure the perceived susceptibility to the (health) threat in question, e.g. "I am at risk for getting HEALTH THREAT"  and "It is possible that I get HEALTH THREAT" with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly agree" as anchors.

Examples of items measuring the perceived susceptibility to a health threat are: "It is likely that I will get infected with HIV" and "It is possible that I will get infected with HIV", with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly agree" as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale (examples are from the Risk Behaviour Diagnosis Scale [Witte et al., 1995]).


## Coding Measurement Instruments

Questions or questionnaires that measure the perceived susceptibility to the (health) threat in question, e.g. "I am at risk for getting HEALTH THREAT" and "It is possible that I get HEALTH THREAT"  with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly agree" as anchors on a 5-point Linkert scale.

Examples of items measuring the perceived susceptibility to a health threat are: "It is likely that I will get infected with HIV" and "It is possible that I will get infected with HIV", with "Strongly disagree" and "Strongly agree" as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale (examples are from the Risk Behaviour Diagnosis Scale [Witte et al., 1995]).


## Eliciting Construct Content (Qualitative Research)

Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.

In this qualitative study, use the questions: "How would you rate the risk associated with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?" or "Can you describe your personal ideas of the risk associated with HEALTH THREAT (e.g. TARGET BEHAVIOUR)?".


## Coding Qualitative Data

Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of perceived threat susceptibility, containing phrases and words such as "high/low risk", "high/low prevalence", "likely/unlikely", and "nobody I know"/"a lot of people I know" (the latter two responses refering to adverse consequences of engaging in the target [risk] behaviour). 

Expressions that demonstrate or imply the degree of perceived threat severity, containing verbs such as "very/not very severe",  "malicious/benign", and "great disturbance"/"minor annoyance" should be coded as dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r.  

Expressions that illustrate the participant's risk perception with regard to the health threat without a reference to susceptibility or severity should be coded as dct:risk_perception_79n2fh4t. For example, if the question is "Can you describe your personal ideas of the risk associated with smoking cigarettes?" and the response is "I know there is a risk associated with smoking, so I try not to smoke to much" no clear reference is made to to the severity of the threat or to personal susceptibility.
