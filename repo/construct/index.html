Action plans direct when, where, and how to carry out this subbehaviour or integrated set of component subbehaviours. If the target behaviour is defined at a very high level of specificity, the action plan may also concern performance of the target behaviour itself.

An action plan is defined as a representation of the plan to perform the plan's target behavior 1) at a specific time (when; temporal); 2) at a specific location or situation (where; contextual); and 3) in a specific way (how; operational). An incomplete action plan, for example only specifying the contextual or operational aspect, is still considered an action plan, and therefore, the 'quality'/'strength' of action plans is variable.

Representations of aspects of a plan to carry out one or more (sub)behaviors are not action plans: action plans must always represent one or more of the three aspects (contextual, temporal, or operational).

The presence of a greater number of action plans (i.e. an action plan for each of the subbehaviours that together constitute the target behaviour), and greater level of detail of action plans (i.e. specifying exactly when, where, and how to carry out the subbehaviours) increase the likelihood of performance of the target behaviour. The extent to which the various action plans related to the target behaviour are present or absent, is represented by the action plan composite (see dct:action_plancomp_79n2w1bh).`));

Answers on these items express if the participant has a plan to perform the subbehaviour according to the description provided. Items should specify when, where, and how the particular subbehaviour is performed.

Items measuring the presence of action plans start with a question stem that presents the situation about which the question is asking, followed by a detailed description of an action plan. Participants are asked to indicate if they have (yes=1/no=0) this specific action plan. 

An example of a question stem followed by three items measuring the presence of three separate action plans for the target behaviour "protecting skin against UV radiation" is:

When you are going on a day trip this summer and large parts of your skin will be uncovered (e.g. at the pool or beach)...
1) Do you plan to check one day or more beforehand if you have sunscreen at home?
2) Do you plan to check if you have sunscreen with you before leaving on the day trip?

In some instances the target behaviour is defined at a very high level of specificity. In that case, dividing the target behaviour into subbehaviours is not possible or redundant, and action plans for performance of the target behaviour itself are measured.

The presence of action plans, ideally, is measured with dichotomous items asking if a specific plan is present (yes/no) for performance of a subbehaviour of the target behaviour. Answers on these items express if the participant has a plan to perform the subbehaviour according to the description provided. Items should specify when, where, and how the particular subbehaviour is performed.

Items measuring the presence of action plans can start with a question stem that presents the issue and situation about which the question is asking, followed by a detailed description of an action plan. Participants are askes to indicate if they have (yes/no) this specific action plan. 

An example of a question stem followed by three items measuring the presence of three separate action plans for the target behaviour "protecting skin against UV radiation" is:

1) Do you plan to check one day or more beforehand if you have sunscreen at home?
2) Do you plan to check if you have sunscreen with you before leaving on the day trip?
3) Do you plan to use sunscreen every 2 hours?

Measures of action plans often provide answer options that express the likelihood the participant expects to perform the decribed behaviour, or the level of agreement or diagreement with performance of the behaviour; i.e. with anchors "Very likely" vs "Very unlikely" and "Totally agree" vs "Totally diagree" on a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. For example: "When you are going to a pop concert, music festival, or dance/house event, do you plan to take ear plugs with you?", with answers ranging from "Very likely" vs "Very unlikely" on a 5-point scale. These items may not measure (the presence of) action plans, but another construct, most likely expectations, and should be coded as such.

See action_plancomp_79n2w1bh for the measurement of a participant's overall presence of action plans for a particular target behaviour `));

          document.write(prepDCTtxt(`Researchers can utilize three complementary methods to assess the degree of actual control of a participant.

First, they can establish whether control factors, expressed by participants during the elicitation of salient beliefs, constitute actual (real) barriers or facilitators. Fishbein & Ajzen (2010) on p. 330-331 provide an example: 'Imagine that lack of public transportation is one of the salient factors mentioned as a possible barrier to getting a colonoscopy. We can try to establish if this is a realistic concern by checking with the transportation authorities on the kinds of public transportation available in the area. This would provide a measure of actual control with respect to this particular factor. In addition, we would also need to ascertain whether it is true that lack of public transportation actually interferes with getting to the doctor‚Äôs office'. 

A second method to assess actual control is to gather background information about the population of interest; specifically concerning factors that may affect their performance of the target behaviour. Identification of these factors, whether personal or environmental, may be enhanced by consulting experts, members of the target population, and those closely living or working together with those members. As a result of increased comprehension of the study population, specific items can be formulated and included in the questionnaire that measure background factors relevant for performance of the target behaviour (e.g. highest level of education achieved), and/or a skills test (see next paragraph) may be developed, and as such these measures may be provide an (indirect) indication of the level of actual control.

Finally, a third method to measure actual control is observation. The current gold standard for objectively measuring enacted behaviour is 'observational coding' (i.e. 'classifying and quantifying verbal and nonverbal behavioural events or psychological states, irrespective of participants' reports or perceptions'). For example, registering actual control over the intention to be physically active by observing a participant's choices during the day, e.g taking the stairs instead of the elevator, going by bike, and not by car, etc.  As a consequence of its time and resource intensive nature, direct observation is not always a viable option. However, technical innovations have augmented the possiblities to track people's behaviour, affect, and physiology outside of laboratory settings, e.g. an accelerometer may give an (objective) indication of a person's ability to remain physically active over a determined time period. Another way of observing actual control is by designing a test in which participants' skills are put to the proof, e.g. by asking participants to prepare a r√©sum√© to test the presence of facilitating factors in applying for a job (example from p. 331 of Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010).

Therefore, anticipated regret with regard to the target behaviour is assessed via the subconstruct action regret (dct:action_regret_79n2w1bj) and inaction regret (dct:inaction_regret_79n2r0t0).

Whether assessment of action regret or inaction regret, or both, is more appropriate depends on the target behaviour and setting of the study. For example, if the target behaviour is "exercising at least six times over the next two weeks", then measuring inaction regret appears more logical: "If you would not exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, how much regret would you feel?", with anchors "none" (=0) and "a lot" (=4). However, one can imagine situations (e.g. exercise as escapism, recovery from injury) in which it makes sense to also measure in the opposite direction (i.e. assess action regret): "If you would exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, how much regret would you feel?".

Expressed as a numeric score, the level of anticipated regret is equal to the level of action or inaction regret, if only one of the two subconstructs is assessed. When both the level of action and inaction regret are measured (with regard to the same target behaviour), the situation is different. In that case, people that experience anticipated regret tend to have a high score on either action or inaction regret. Therefore, calculating a sum or mean score for the two measures combined does not make sense, as this would make the scores of people with a strong experience of anticipated regret (e.g. 4+0=4 sumscore) equal to people with a moderate experience of anticipated regret (e.g. 2+2=4 sumscore), which would no do justice to their experience. Furthermore, it seems likely that for the former group, the instigation towards action/inaction with respect to the target behaviour is greater, precisely because in this group anticipated regret is experienced stronger. Creating a sum or average score from action and inaction regret scores thus does not make sense, neither to express the level of experienced anticipated regret nor to predict engagement vs non-engagement in the target behaviour. 

Substracting one score from the other, or multiplying scores, does not help with the interpretation either. Therefore, no combined score is created from action and inaction regret and scores for both subcontructs are independently assessed and interpreted.

For anticipated regret expressed as a composite score (i.e. the summation of action and inaction regret scores) see dct:anticip_regret_79n2w1bh`));

In most cases either action or inaction regret is used. Which one of the two is used, is mostly guided by the target behaviour. 

For example in the study "Deciding to exercise: The role of anticipated regret" (Abraham & Sheeran, 2004), the target behaviour is "exercising at least six times over the next two weeks", and the two items measuring anticipated regret both assess action regret (although the authors do no mention such a specification): "If I did not exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, I would feel regret" and "‚ÄòIf I did not exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, I would feel upset‚Äô, witch anchors "definitely no" and "definitely yes" for both items.`));

1) Firstly, participants are asked if their behaviour is in line with with the guidelines for that particular behaviour (yes/no). If the guideline is not known, in an introduction to the question this information is provided.

2) Secondly, participants' actual engagement in the target behaviour is assessed using objective measures (e.g. accelerometer and heart rate monitor to measure actual physical activity, caloric calculations to measure food intake).

3) Thirdly, the accuracy of participants' perception of their behaviour meeting the guidelines can be assessed by comparing the outcomes of step 1 and 2. As a result of this comparison, four awareness groups can be created: overestimators, underestimators, realistic (not meeting guideline), and realistic (meeting guideline). Thus, the latter two groups are aware of their behaviour, while the first two groups are not.

See "Awareness of physical activity in healthy middle-aged adults: a cross-sectional study of associations with sociodemographic, biological, behavioural, and psychological factors" (Godino et al., 2014) for a sample application of this method.

If these objective measures can not be used, self-report of behaviour assessed by questionniares or interviews are an alternative option. However, one should take into account that these latter instruments by definition measure a subjective representation of behaviour. Moreover, whereas there is general agreement about the definition of a specific behaviour ("running"), this is not the case when asking about a broad behavioural category, such as "exercising". To assess a category of behaviours via self-report, therefore, we must provide a clear definition of the category in question and specify action, target, context, and time.

Depending on the nature of the behaviour, engagement in the behaviour can be conceived as binary (i.e. one either does or does not engage in the target behaviour, e.g. getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter of frequency (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour with a frequency from zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g. the frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter of intensity (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour to a degree from zero up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g. the amount of kilocalories one consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e. one engages in the target behaviour with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g. how frequently one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).

The instructions for developing a self-report instrument to measure behaviour, logically derive from the foregoing consideration regarding the nature of the behaviour of interest. For example, for a dichotomous response option (yes/no) the question can be formulated in the following way: "Did you get tested for STIs during the last six months?". If the behaviour is a matter of frequency, multiple response options may be given, e.g.: "During the last seven days, how many days did you drink two or more alcoholic drinks?", with response options ranging from 0 to 7.

          document.write(prepDCTtxt(`Skinner (2007) describes the state of assessment in the field of coping as "chaotic and confusing", and in a review (Skinner et al., 2003) identified over 100 assessments, tapping over 400 ways of coping.

Among the various measures, self-report instruments exist to assess coping styles among members of various groups (adults, children, adolescents, elderly), and scales may be broadly applicable, while others are ment for situation-specific application (e.g. health-related issues). The COPE (Carver, Scheier, & Weintraub, 1989) is the most frequently used instrument for broad application, and also one of the most commonly used measures in situation-specific contexts (Kato, 2015). 

The 60-item COPE consists of 15 subscales (e.g. "active coping" and "acceptance") and its theoretical development is based on the models of behavioral self-regulation (Carver & Scheier, 1981) and stress and coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). The COPE assumes that individual coping strategies are relatively stable across different types of stressors. 

Individuals that participate in the COPE are asked to indicate on a 4-points scale what they usually do when they experience a stressful event (1 = I usually don't do this at all, 2 = I usually do this a little bit, 3 = I usually do this a medium amount, 4 = I usually do this a lot). Examples of items used in the COPE are: "I get upset and let my emotions out", "I laugh about the situation", "I daydream about things other than this" and "I think hard about what steps to take".

The COPE, in its original form, measures coping style across different types of stressors. However, researchers have also adapted the scale to assess coping in specific situations (e.g. by replacing "stressful event" by a more narrow description of a potentially stressful situation), or by using only a selection of the 15 subscales. The COPE does not have an overall score, and the authors do not endorse combining subscales or deducing a dominant coping style from the scores (Carver, 2013).

Researchers that want to create their own coping scale (e.g. for specific groups, situations, or risk behaviours) can use the framework provided by Skinner et al. (2003), which identifies a dozen core families of coping based on action types. Any measure of coping, according to the authors, no matter the domain, developmental level, or time frame, should include ways of coping from each of these 12 families.

Different ways are used to classify coping styles into higher-order families. These classifications are often problematic (see Skinner et al., 2003 for a thorough discussion). Engagement and disengagement coping (see dct:engCoping and dct:disengCoping) is the higher-order structure adhered by Carver (2019), and the one used here. One should, however, take into account that the presence or absence of particular coping styles should be assessed at a higher level of specificity, e.g. coping styles pertaining to the 12 families identified by Skinner et al. (2003) or the 15 subscales of the COPE (Carver, 2013) should be selected. After an assessment is made at this higher level of specificity, subsequently one can potentially classify an individual's dominant overall coping style as engagement  (see dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengagement coping (see dct:disengCoping_79n2w1bk). Which particular coping styles researchers should direct their focus on, will depend on their appropriateness for the target event and age group (Skinner, 2007).

After an assessment is made at this higher level of specificity, subsequently one can potentially classify an individual's dominant overall coping style as engagement  (see dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengagement coping (see dct:disengCoping_79n2w1bk).`));

Therefore, whether an descriptive norm belief exerts influence (and if so, to what extent) on the descriptive norm beliefs composite (dct:descrNorms_belCom_73dnt5zn), and whether a particular descriptive norm belief lowers or increases the perception that salient normative referents are performing the behaviour in question, can only be deduced by concurrent consultation of the two subcomponents of which it is constructed. Table 4.1 on p. 136 of the Reasoned Action Approach book (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010)  provides an example how the subcomponents exert an influence on individual normative beliefs (in Table 4.1 it concerns injunctive normative beliefs).

Nevertheless, regardless of the specific instrument used, an individual overall response pattern can be classified as either being typical of engagement (dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengagement coping, with "responses that are oriented toward either the source of stress, or toward one‚Äôs emotions and thoughts‚Äù representing engagement coping, while ‚Äúresponses that are oriented away from the stressor or one‚Äôs emotions/thoughts‚Äù indicating the dominant presence of a disengagement coping style (Compas et al., 2001). 

Disengagement coping  may be conceived at the highest level of a hierarchical factor structure with three levels (Tobin et al., 1989), with one level below, "problem disengagement" and "emotion disengagement", and at the lowest level, respectively, "problem avoidance" and "wishful thinking" (for problem disengagement), and "self criticism" and "social withdrawal" (for emotion disengagement). Therefore, when an individidual scores high on these lower level coping strategies, and relatively low on the coping strategies falling under engagement coping (dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy), the dominant coping pattern can be classified as "disengagement coping".

However, a problem is that each coping instrument assesses and classifies coping styles differently. For example, the aforementioned coping styles "problem avoidance" and "wishful thinking" are distinct categories of the Coping Strategies Inventory (Tobin et al., 1989), but not of many other coping style measures. Therefore, whether a particular coping style pertains to the higher-order class of engagement or disengament coping, should be decided based on factor analysis or an a priori categorization of each individual coping style as either falling under the umbrella of engagement or disengament coping. `));

Therefore, whether a particular coping style pertains to the higher-order class of engagement or disengament coping, should be decided based on factor analysis or an a priori categorization of each individual coping style as either falling under the umbrella of engagement (dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengament coping, with "responses that are oriented toward either the source of stress, or toward one‚Äôs emotions and thoughts‚Äù representing engagement coping, while ‚Äúresponses that are oriented away from the stressor or one‚Äôs emotions/thoughts‚Äù indicating the dominant presence of a disengagement coping style (Compas et al., 2001).`));

Examples of such items are: "Is your capacity to control the expression of vicious comments to friends or family reduced when preparing for an important test or exam?", "Is your capacity to control your alcohol intake reduced when tired from an exhausting day at work?", "Is your ability to control your exposure to loud music (e.g. by wearing ear plugs, restricting volume, or keeping a distance from loudspeakers) reduced when under the influence of alcohol of drugs?

The range of situations and circumstances that may elicit "ego depletion" in the definition of the present DCT is broader. Moreover, it reflects an individual's perception of situations and circumstances  in which ego depletion occurs. This perception is not necessarily a reflection of actual ego depletion taking place. Therefore, the  sequential-task experimental paradigm is not an appropriate method to measure the present construct.

To measure the broader meaning of ego depletion, questions are presented in which participants are asked to which extent they believe their ability is reduced to control dominant responses with respect to the target behaviour in the situation or circumstances described. For example: "Is your capacity to control the expression of vicious comments to friends or family reduced when preparing for an important test or exam?" or "Is your ability to control your exposure to loud music (e.g. by wearing ear plugs, restrict the volume, or keeping a distance from loudspeakers) reduced when under the influence of alcohol of drugs? ". Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "Severly reduced" to "Not reduced at all".

Note that to accurately measure ego depletion, items have to match with the specific target behaviour and target group.

Ego depletion, as defined in the present construct (dct:ego_depletion_79n2r0sy) can be regarded as a subconstruct of dct:capacity_73dnt602, i.e. it represents a temporary reduced capacity for self-control (dct:self_control_79n2fh4t), induced by the situation or by circumstances.

As a consequence, multiple measurement methods may be employed, and possibly integrated, to measure emotion. Self-report, other-report, observation, and neurophysiology are the measurement methods most dominantly used in emotion research. 

A three-step system for choosing a measure of emotion can be employed (Ekkekakis, 2008): 1) Decide whether you wish to study core affect, emotion, or mood (these are related but different constructs); 2) Choose the most appropriate theoretical framework for the chosen construct; 3) Select the psychometrically strongest measure based on the chosen theoretical framework.

In the context of behaviour change, emotions may exert an influence on the target behaviour in various ways. The mere thought of performing the behaviour may trigger a strong emotion and in- or decrease the likelihood of performing the behaviour. Emotions may also affect the actual performance of the behaviour. The kinds of emotion that are experienced before, during, and after the behaviour may also be diverse (e.g. anger, shame, or joy).

The foregoing must be taken into account when a measurement instrument is chosen or developed, e.g. if a (fictitious) research hypothesis is that the experience of "positive" emotions (e.g. joy, pride) and "negative" emotions (e.g. anger, shame), respectively, de- and increase the number of cigarettes smoked during a day, then retrospective assessment of experienced emotions with a self-report questionnaire likely is not the most appropriate instrument, but an measurement method that is able to record emotions at various moments of the day such as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) is a better candidate.`));

Nevertheless, regardless of the specific instrument used, an individual overall response pattern can be classified as either being typical of engagement or disengagement coping (see dct:disengCoping_79n2w1bk), with "responses that are oriented toward either the source of stress, or toward one‚Äôs emotions and thoughts‚Äù representing engagement coping, while ‚Äúresponses that are oriented away from the stressor or one‚Äôs emotions/thoughts‚Äù indicating the dominant presence of a disengagement coping style (Compas et al., 2001). 

Engagement coping  may be conceived at the highest level of a hierarchical factor structure with three levels (Tobin et al., 1989), with one level below, "problem engagement" and "emotion engagement", and at the lowest level, respectively, "problem solving" and "cognitive restructuring" (for problem engagement), and "express emotions" and "social support" (for emotion engagement). Therefore, when an individidual scores high on these lower level coping strategies, and relatively low on the coping strategies falling under disengagement coping (dct:disengCoping_79n2w1bk), the dominant coping pattern can be classified as "engagement coping".

However, a problem is that each coping instrument, measures and classifies coping styles differently. For example, the aforementioned coping styles "problem solving" and "cognitive restructuring" are distinct categories of the Coping Strategies Inventory (Tobin et al., 1989), but not of many other coping style measures. Therefore, whether a particular coping style pertains to the higher-order class of engagement or disengament coping, should be decided based on factor analysis or an a priori categorization of each individual coping style as either falling under the umbrella of engagement or disengagement coping. `));

Ajzen & Fishbein state on p.104 of the Reasoned Action Approach book (2010) that the composite measure of beliefs is assumed to determine the (experiential) attitude, and should not be interpreted as an indirect measure of (experiential) attitude. A low correlation between the beliefs composite and a direct measure of experiential attitude may be an indication that the expectancy-value index is based on an inappropriate set of (nonsalient) beliefs, or that the measure of belief strength may be scored inappropriately.

          document.write(prepDCTtxt(`Experiential attitude belief expectations are measured using questions in a questionnaire that are referred to as 'items'. To measure an experiential attitude belief expectation, first, identify exactly which potential experiential consequence of the target behavior (e.g. a specific experience or sensation) you want to measure. Then, establish whether accurately describing the spectrum of possibilities regarding this experiential consequence requires a unidimensional scale or a bidimensional scale. Most potential consequences of a target behavior can be perceived either to *increase* or *decrease* upon performance of the target behavior, requiring a bidimensional scale. For example, some people might expect they will feel *less* relaxed if they drink alcohol, while others might expect they will feel *more* relaxed. However, in rare cases, one of the two dimensions can be excluded a priori, in which case a unidimensional scale suffices. For example, the degree to which people will expect they will feel less hungry may vary; but it is excessively unlikely that somebody might expect that if they eat a whole pizza, they will then feel *more* hungry. Therefore, in that case, one might want to choose a unidimensional scale. In general, a rule of thumb is that if the 'default state' of this experiential consequence resembles absence of the experience, and therefore, engaging in the target behavior can only have an effect in one direction, a unidimensional scale can be used. However, when engaging in the target behavior can conceivably increase *or* decrease this experiential consequence, a bidimensional scale is required.

Once it is clear whether a bidimensional or unidimensional scale should be used, the construction of the item stem and the two anchors can start. Make sure to formulate the item stem such that it makes clear that you are asking people about *their* expectation (not what they think holds more generally).

For unidimensional scales, create an item stem that explicitly lists the single dimension that expresses the experiential consequence (e.g. feeling full after eating a pizza). As anchors, always use 'Very unlikely' and 'Very likely'. An example item would be: 'If I eat a whole pizza at once, it is ... that it will make me feel full. [Very unlikely|Very likely]'. However, as explained above, unidimensional scales can rarely be used in most circumstances, so bidimensional scales are usually required.

For bidimensional scales, the item stem cannot explicitly list only one of the two dimensions (e.g. 'feeling much less relaxed' or 'feeling much more relaxed'). This is because this would create a unidimensional or ambiguous response scale. People who would score low on the unidimensional scale might mean either that they don't think that consequence will occur, or that they think that the opposite consequence will occur. For example, when creating an item 'If I drink a glass of alcohol, I will feel much more relaxed. [Very unlikely|Very likely]', people who respond 'Very unlikely' can mean either that they expect to feel much less relaxed, or that they expect that drinking a glass of alcohol will have no effect on how relaxed they will feel.

Therefore, capturing the full potential breadth of the beliefs of your target population requires asking what they expect exactly. To do this, create an item stem that contains the target behavior, and anchors that express the extremes of the bidimensional scale. For example, 'Drinking alcohol makes me feel ... [much less relaxed|much more relaxed]'. Sometimes, the two extremes of the dimension you want to measure can be expressed in two antonyms, such as 'Drinking alcohol makes me feel ... [much more relaxed|much more excited]'.

Once the item stem and the two anchors have been determined, decide which response scale to use. For bidimensional scales, seven-point scales are preferred, as these leave three degrees of expression in each dimension (the mid-point representing the expectation that the behavior does not have a consequence regarding this specific experiential attitude belief). For unidimensional scales, five-point scales suffice. Try to always be consistent in the scale valence; in languages that are read from left to right, always place the most passive/low/less/weak/unlikely scale extreme (anchor) on the left, and the most active/high/more/strong/likely scale extreme (anchor) on the right. Do not reverse this order for one or more items.

When combining multiple items in one measurement instrument, if both evaluations of unidimensional consequences and evaluations of bidimensional consequences are measured, either use two matrices or combine them in one that uses seven-point scales for all items.

The item or set of items should be accompanied by an instruction that makes clear that you are asking people about *their* expectation (not what they think holds more generally).`));

Note that no specified goals are formulated. If one wants to identify the goals that are associated with a target behaviour, an elicitation study among the study population can be performed. This will identify the most salient goal beliefs. 

After the elicitation study,  participants can be asked to respond to two questions with respect to each salient goal belief, one question to assess the perceived likelihood that engagement in the target behaviour will lead to attainment of the goal, and the other to measure the perceived importance of this goal. 

To get a total quantitative score of a goal belief, the perceived likelihood that engagement in the target behaviour will lead to attainment of the goal is multiplied by the perceived importance of the goal. The total score of a goal belief enables the assessment of the impact of a specific goal belief, in comparison with other goal beliefs, and thus helps to identify the most important goals people may have for engaging in the target behaviour.

The choice of a habit measure depends on the goal of the measurement and the setting where the assessment is ought to take place; each of the four aforementioned instruments tap on different aspects of habit (e.g. automaticity, repetition, and self-identity in case of the SRHI), and while the latter three measures can be incorprated into a survey, association measures, in contrast, can only be administered in a controlled laboratory setting.

The 12-item SRHI (Verplanken & Orbell, 2003) is the instrument most frequently used to measure habit (Gardner, 2015). The SRHI is supposed to measure behaviour performed across contexts. However, specific context cues can be added by modifying the stem of SRHI-items.

All 12 SRHI-items start with the sentence "TARGET BEHAVIOUR is something...", after which a particular statement follows for each individual item, such as "I do frequently", "I do automatically", and "That would require effort not to do". The items are accompanied by response scales anchored by agree/disagree and contain five or more response categories.

An example of an item measuring "smoking cigarettes" (the target behaviour) as habit, thus, would be: "Smoking cigarettes is something I do automatically".

A critique on self-report measures of habit, such as the SRHI, is that they require respondents to reflect on behaviours that are automatic and, as such, outside of conscious awareness (Van Bree, 2018).`));

In addition, self-report instruments are used to measure impulsive choice and/or impulsive action, of which the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is most commonly used. The BIS-11 consists of 30 items, and answers on each item are measured on a 4-point scale (rarely/never, occasionally, often, almost always), with higher scores indicative of greater impulsivity. Examples of items used are: "I act on the spur of the moment" and " I say things without thinking".

The aforementioned tests measure impulsive action as a general trait, not related to specific behaviours or objects. If one wants to assess impulsivity with regard to a particular behaviour or object, specific questions can be composed that measure the frequency impulses are experienced, and/or the strength of these impulses, in situations related to the target behaviour/object.

To measure impulsivity related to a specific behaviour, the stem "When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR...." can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of impulsivity. For example: "When it comes to smoking cigarettes... 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don't manage to plan my behaviour 4) I act on the spur of the moment 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "totally agree" to "totally disagree".

Alternatively, a series of unique items can be composed to measure behaviour- or object-related impulsivity, such as: "I don't wear ear plugs because when I decide to go to an event or concert it's on the spur of the moment" (for target behaviour "wearing ear plugs when exposed to loud music") and "When I hear a good track, I just have to turn off the volume restriction" (for target behaviour "use volume restriction on music players") with responses "totally agree" and "totally disagree" as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale.

Impulsivity can be regarded as the converse of self-control. Therefore, the same instrument to assess self control (dct:self_control_79n2fh4t) can potentially be used to measure impulsivity. However, the scoring for the questionnaire items should be reversed (see dct:self_control_79n2fh4t for an example).

In this qualitative study, one of two different approaches can be followed:

1) The participant is encouraged to name demographic factors that he/she perceives to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour.

2) a) The participant is asked if he/she perceives a particular demographic factor to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour. This question can be repeated for other demographic factors the researcher thinks to be relevant.

   b) The participant is asked to name the factors out of a series of demographic factors that he/she perceives to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour.

When the first approach is chosen, use the following question 'Please list any demographic factors that may have an influence on your engagement in the TARGET BEHAVIOUR‚Äô.

One should consider that the concept of "demographic influences" for most study populations may be too difficult to understand, or the range of demographic influences considered may be too narrow. In that case, the researcher can adopt the second approach and either:

a) ask if the participant perceives a particular demographic factor to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour, e.g."Do you think that being single has an influence on your alcohol consumption?". Possibly followed by the same question for other demographic factors, e.g. "Do you think that being unemployed has an influence on your alcohol consumption?".
or
b) name a number of demographic influences, using the following introduction and question: "I will name a couple of so-called demographic factors: [name demograhic variables of interest]". "Please list those factors that you think have an influence on your engagement in the TARGET BEHAVIOUR". For example: "I will name a couple of so-called demographic factors: partner status, employment status, nationality, and religion. Please list those factors that you think have an influence on your alcohol consumption."

Any of the aforementioned questions is followed by "Please explain" if the participant names a demographic factor without giving an explanation for this particular response.

In behaviour change research, environmental influences are most often regarded to exert a "distal" effect on behaviour, i.e. exerting influence on behaviour through other variables with a more direct, "proximal", effect. As these latter variables have a greater potential for change, the focus in questionnaires is mostly on these variables, and environmental influences are considered background factors, measured with a few questions, most often at the beginning of the questionnaire. 

Note that certain variables may be coded as both a environmental and demographic influence (dct:inflDemographic_79n2w1bk). Whether classification as the former or latter is more appropriate depends on the focus of the research, e.g. if the impact of green neigboorhood spaces on physical activity is studied, it is appropraite to classify living in a deprived neighboorhood with limited spaces for leisure time activities as an environmental influence rather than a demographic influence.

In this qualitative study, one of two different approaches can be followed:

1) The participant is encouraged to name environmental factors that he/she perceives to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour.

2) a) The participant is asked if he/she perceives a particular environmental factors factor to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour. This question can be repeated for other environmental factors the researcher thinks to be relevant.

   b) The participant is asked to name the factors out of a series of environmental factors that he/she perceives to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour.

When the first approach is chosen, use the following question 'Please list any environmental factors that may have an influence on your engagement in the TARGET BEHAVIOUR‚Äô.

One should consider that the concept of "environmental influences" for most study populations may be too difficult to understand, or the range of environmental influences considered may be too narrow. In that case, the researcher can adopt the second approach and either:

a) ask if the participant perceives a particular environmental factor to have an influence on his/her engagement in the target behaviour, e.g."Do you think that the number of parks in your neighboorhood has an influence on your obesity?". Possibly followed by the same question for other environmental factors, e.g. "Do you think that the number of fitness centres in your neighboorhood has an influence on your obesity?".
or
b) name a number of environmental influences, using the following introduction and question: "I will name a couple of so-called environmental factors: [name environmental variables of interest]". "Please list those factors that you think have an influence on your engagement in the TARGET BEHAVIOUR". For example: "I will name a couple of so-called environmental factors: the presence of parks, the presence of fitness centres, the presence of bicycle lanes, and the presence of food markets. Please list those factors that you think have an influence on your obesity."

Any of the aforementioned questions is followed by "Please explain" if the participant names an environmental factor without giving an explanation for this particular response.

This, preferably, is represented graphically (e.g. in a table or index) and, additionally, in an equation.

The authors state on p.104 of  the Reasoned Action Approach book (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2010) that the composite measure of beliefs is assumed to determine the (instrumental) attitude, and should not be interpreted as an indirect measure of (instrumental) attitude. A low correlation between the beliefs composite and a direct measure of instrumental attitude may be an indication that the expectancy-value index (i.e. the attitude beliefs composite) is based on an inappropriate set of (nonsalient) beliefs, or that the measure of belief strength may be scored inappropriately.

          document.write(prepDCTtxt(`Instrumental attitude belief expectations are measured using questions in a questionnaire that are referred to as 'items'. To measure an instrumental attitude belief expectation, first, identify exactly which potential instrumental consequence of the target behavior (e.g. a specific benefit or advantage) you want to measure. Then, establish whether accurately describing the spectrum of possibilities regarding this instrumental consequence requires a unidimensional scale or a bidimensional scale. Most potential consequences of a target behavior can be perceived either to *increase* or *decrease* upon performance of the target behavior, requiring a bidimensional scale. For example, some people might expect that drinking four cups of coffee every day contributes to their goal of being healthy, whether others might expect that that is unhealthy instead, expecting that not consuming any coffee at all is more healthy. However, in rare cases, one of the two dimensions can be excluded a priori, in which case a unidimensional scale suffices. For example, the degree to which people will expect that exercising regularly for a month will increase their health may vary; but is it excessively unlikely that somebody might expect that if they exercise regularly for a month, their health will *decrease*. Therefore, in that case, one might want to choose a unidimensional scale. In general, a rule of thumb is that if the 'default state' of this instrumental consequence resembles absence of the potential consequence, and therefore, engaging in the target behavior can only have an effect in one direction, a unidimensional scale can be used. However, when engaging in the target behavior can conceivably increase *or* decrease this instrumental consequence, a bidimensional scale is required.

Once it is clear whether a bidimensional or unidimensional scale should be used, the construction of the item stem and the two anchors can start. Make sure to formulate the item stem such that it makes clear that you are asking people about *their* expectation (not what they think holds more generally).

For unidimensional scales, create an item stem that explicitly lists the single dimension that expresses the instrumental consequence (e.g. exercising regularly for a month leading to increased health). As anchors, always use 'Very unlikely' and 'Very likely'. An example item would be: 'If I exercise regularly for a month, it is ... that my health will increase. [Very unlikely|Very likely]'. However, as explained above, unidimensional scales can rarely be used in most circumstances, so bidimensional scales are usually required.

For bidimensional scales, the item stem cannot explicitly list only one of the two dimensions (e.g. 'become much less healthy' or 'become much more healthy'). This is because this would create a unidimensional or ambiguous response scale. People who would score low on the unidimensional scale might mean either that they don't think that consequence will occur, or that they think that the opposite consequence will occur. For example, when creating an item 'If I drink four cups of coffee every day, I will become much more healthy. [Very unlikely|Very likely]', people who respond 'Very unlikely' can mean either that they expect to feel much less healthy, or that they expect that drinking four cups of coffee every day will have no effect on their health.

Therefore, capturing the full potential breadth of the beliefs of your target population requires asking what they expect exactly. To do this, create an item stem that contains the target behavior, and anchors that express the extremes of the bidimensional scale. For example, 'Drinking four cups of coffee every day leads to me being ... [much less healthy|much more healthy]'. Sometimes, the two extremes of the dimension you want to measure can be expressed in two antonyms, such as 'Drinking four cups of coffee makes me ... [very idle|very productive]'.

Once the item stem and the two anchors have been determined, decide which response scale to use. For bidimensional scales, seven-point scales are preferred, as these leave three degrees of expression in each dimension (the mid-point representing the expectation that the behavior does not have a consequence regarding this specific instrumental attitude belief). For unidimensional scales, five-point scales suffice. Try to always be consistent in the scale valence; in languages that are read from left to right, always place the most passive/low/less/weak/unlikely scale extreme (anchor) on the left, and the most active/high/more/strong/likely scale extreme (anchor) on the right. Do not reverse this order for one or more items.

When combining multiple items in one measurement instrument, if both evaluations of unidimensional consequences and evaluations of bidimensional consequences are measured, either use two matrices or combine them in one that uses seven-point scales for all items.

The item or set of items should be accompanied by an instruction that makes clear that you are asking people about *their* expectation (not what they think holds more generally).`));

The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) (Guay et al., 2000) is a frequently used self-report instrument to assess whether behaviour is intrinsically regulated. Beside intrinsic regulation of behaviour, the SIMS assesses identified regulation, external regulation, and amotivation, and is used to assess motivation for various activities (e.g. physical exercise, academic performance). 

The SIMS asks participants ‚ÄúWhy are you currently engaged in this activity?‚Äù. Scale items represent potential answers to this question. Responses are given on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from "Does not correspond at all" to "Corresponds exactly".

Examples of statements expressing intrinsic regulation of behaviour are: "Because I think that this activity is interesting", "Because I think that this activity is pleasant", "Because this activity is fun", and "Because I feel good when doing this activity".`));

          document.write(prepDCTtxt(`To measure the motivation to comply with a given social referent, measure how much people want to do what the relevant social referents think they should do with regard to the target behavior.

In most behaviors and populations, unidimensional scales can be used. As item stem, use 'When it comes to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], I want to do what [SOCIAL REFERENT] think(s) I should do.', and as anchors, 'Not at all' and 'Very much'. For example, 'When it comes to whether I avoid meat during dinner, I want to do what my partner thinks I should do. ['Not at all'|'Very much']' or 'When it comes to my coffee consumption, I want to do what my colleagues think I should do. ['Not at all'|'Very much']'.

However, for some behaviors and some populations, it's not only possible that individuals want to do what a social referent thinks they should do to a certain degree, but it's also possible that the individual actively wants to do what that social referent would *disapprove* of. For example, people may strongly want to clearly demonstrate distancing themselves from members of a perceived outgroup (e.g. adolescents may want to disobey middle-aged people).

In such situations, you can use a bidimensional scale to account for this variation. Use item stem 'When it comes to [TARGET BEHAVIOR], I want to do what [SOCIAL REFERENT]...' with anchors 'Do(es)n't want me to do' and 'Want(s) me to do'. For example, 'When it comes to condom use with a partner, I want to do what other adolescents... [Don‚Äôt want me to do|Want me to do]', or 'When it comes to how late I go to bed, I want to do what my older sibling ... [Doesn‚Äôt want me to do|Wants me to do]'`));

In its simplest form, this can be measured with the question "Are you motivated to engage in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?" followed by either a dichotomous response option ("yes"/"no") or a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "Very Much" to "Not at all".

Definitions and operationalisations of motivation vary greatly across studies. One influential theory on human motivation is self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985). According to this theory, different types of motivation underlie human behaviour. These different types of motivation are positioned on a continuum from high to low levels of self-determination, with intrinsic motivation and amotivation at the extreme ends. The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) (Guay et al., 2000) is a frequently used self-report instrument to assess which type of motivation dominates for a particular behaviour or activity (see dct:intrinsicBehaviour_79n2r0t0, dct:integratedBehaviour_79n2r0t0, dct:identifiedBehaviour_79n2r0t0, dct:introjBehaviour_79n2r0t0, and dct:extBehaviour_79n2r0sz).

Questions that measure specific types of motivation (such as the questions used in the SIMS), and not motivation in general (for engagement in the target behaviour) should not be coded as dct:motivation_79n2fh4q, but should be given the code pertaining to the specific subconstruct measured (e.g. dct:extBehaviour_79n2r0sz).

Instruments that measure need satisfaction most often assume that humans have universal needs. In particular, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and Maslow's (1968) Hierarchy of Needs have instigated the development of instruments to measure the satisfaction of these universal needs. The Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) (Gagn√© et al., 2003) and the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (BMPN) (Sheldon et al., 2012) measure needs from a SDT-perspective, while the Basic Need Satisfaction Inventory (BNSI) (Leidy et al., 1994)) adopts Maslow's standpoint on human needs.

For behaviour change (e.g. instigating healthy lifestyle choices), measuring general, as well as measuring domain- or activity-specific need satisfaction may have its merits. For example, Timmerman et al. (2001) found that the lower the level of basic need satisfaction, the more likely one is engaged in emotional eating. Need satisfaction at this general level, however, is harder to change than needs being met by specific activities or in a narrow domain. Therefore, instruments pertaining to the latter category are preferably used.

Need satisfaction can be asssessed by following a series of four steps: Firstly, depending on the theoretical background one adheres to (e.g. SDT) a list of of universal needs is composed. Secondly, to measure whether these needs are met by the situation or activity of interest, for each of these needs a number of items are used to assess the level of needs satisfaction. Thirdly, the item sumscores for each need, and the overall sumcore of all needs together are calculated. Fourth, the degree individual needs and all need together are satisfied by an activity or situation can be deduced from the two sumscores. 

Need satisfaction in a particular domain can, for example, be assessed with the following sample items. These sample items pertain to the assessment of need satisfaction at work but (with slight adjustments) could also be used to measure need satisfaction in other domains or concerning specific activities. Participants are asked to indicate how true each statement is for them, with answer option ranging from "Not at all true" to "Very true" on a 7-point Likert scale: "I feel like I can make a lot of inputs to deciding how my job gets done", "People at work care about me", and "Most days I feel a sense of accomplishment from working". These three items reflect what SDT regards as the three basic human needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence.

In a similar fashion, other expressions of needs may be given the coding dct:need_79n2fh4r and of another dct, e.g. dct:injunctiveNorms_73dnt5zj, if the participant expresses that approval of people around him/her of his/her behaviour is regarded as an important individual need.`));

The choice for a particular instrument is largely driven by the specific personality theory one adheres to; for example the influential Big Five model of personality traits, or five-factor model (FFM), has inspired the creation of a number of self-report instruments (such as the the Revised NEO Personality Inventory [NEO PI-R]) that assess the relative presence of each of the Big Five personality traits (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) in a person.

The NEO PI-R consists of 240 items such as "I like to have a lot of people around me" and "I often find myself in disagreements with my family and colleagues". Answers are given on a 5-points Likert scale ranging from "Totally disagree" to "Totally agree". Each of the five personality dimensions in the NEO PI-R consists of six facets. At the broadest level, personality can be described in terms of five basic dimensions by summing the six facets in each domain. More precise estimates of standing on the five factors, can be provided by factor scores (i.e. a weighted combination of scores on all 30 facets). For interpretation, an individual's scores on the NEO PI-R are compared to a relevant reference group (e.g. adult men).

          document.write(prepDCTtxt(`Problematic Hypersexuality (PH) is defined as the experience of distress and negative consequences due to hypersexual urges and behavior - to the extent that the experience of PH causes the individual to at least consider seeking help. The construct of PH we base on the common and unique criteria (ten in total) found in three perspectives on PH.

---- Before we present these ten criteria we distilled from the three perspectives, we note that the three perspectives come as diagnostic systems, while our definition of PH must be taken as a construct definition for research. This means, among others, that what are called 'criteria' within the diagnostic systems, we call 'characteristics'. With this Decentralized Construct Taxonomy (DCT) definition on PH we hope to define as clearly as possible what we mean by PH in our studies (references to the studies using this definition can be found under 'Comments'). As our research progresses, the DCT definition of PH might change. Also, others might use other but similar constructs that can be equally valid, if made explicit. Current research practices often suffer from hidden heterogeneity: definitions are not made explicit or are imprecise. Often constructs that bear the same name, prove to differ in small but important details. Reasons to adhere to explicit heterogeneity in definitions of constructs are explained in more detail here: (Peters & Crutzen, 2022, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8tpcv).

---- We now return to the DCT definition of PH. The three diagnostic perspectives on PH we make use of, are: 1) Sex addiction; 2) Hypersexual Disorder; and 3) Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder. The ten characteristics of PH we apply in this DCT of PH are based on 6 overlapping criteria and 4 unique criteria for PH retrieved from these three perspectives. The 6 overlapping criteria for PH we retrieved, are: 1) Intense focus on and preoccupation with sex; 2) Repetitive sexual acitivities leading to neglect of selfcare and responsibilities; 3) Negative consequences in one or more life domains; 4) Disregard of risk of harm to self or others: 5) Failed attempts to stop the sexual behavior; and 6) Continue PH behavior despite negative consequences. From the 'sex addiction' perspective we retrieved the following criteria: 7) Tolerance (the need to increase sexual intenstiy of frequency); and 8) Withdrawal symptoms (e.g. restlessness). From the 'hypersexual disorder' perspective we retrieved: 9) Sex used to cope with dysphoric mood states or stressful life events. From the 'compulsive sexual behavior disorder' perspective we retrieved: 10) Continue PH behavior despite loss of pleasure in sex.  These ten potentially cue valid characteristics of PH we consider as more permanent and relatively stable. With cue valid we mean: to a greater or lesser degree uniquely pertaining to hypersexuality. IRT validation studies can decide on the importance of each of these characteristics in assessing PH and are able to assess cue validity when relevant subpopulations are included in research. Furthermore, we consider PH to be ruled by two drivers: 1) high sexual desire; and 2) emotion dysregulation with regard to sexuality (Kingston, 2018; specifies these drivers as 'dimensions'). These two drivers we see as necessary for PH to occur but not as sufficient for PH to be the case. The ten characteristics are connected to the two drivers as outcomes are connected to processes. The process in PH that is maintained by the two drivers is that of a vicious circle- we hypothesize. Negative feelings (e.g. shame) lead to sexually acting out in order to cope with them. The sexual acting out reinforces shame, thus increasing the risk of a new cycle of shame and sexual acting out. Our investigations of this vicious circle is underway but at the time not conclusive. Therefore, this DCT of PH should be considered as preliminary and open to change. If a vicious circle for PH is not confirmed - or even disconfirmed - this will lead to a different DCT for PH. If a vicious circle is confirmed, this might lead to a more detailed description of its nature, and this too will lead to an adaptation of this DCT for PH.

---- To conclude this definition: we consider Problematic Hypersexuality as delineated from Non-problematic Hypersexuality (NH). By NH we mean the experience of hypersexuality without enduring distress or negative consequences. Hypersexuality in general - in short defined as taking great interest in experiencing sexuality - is the overarching concept, binding NH and PH together. In the future both NH and Hypersexuality might be awarded their own DCT.

---- We offer the following figure as an overview of this DCT definition of PH and note that cue valid characteristics are best established using IRT validation, while measuring driving processes of PH can best be done using ESM techniques: https://osf.io/89ha7
Both research methodologies (IRT and ESM) will profit from comparing a PH populations with relevant other populations and we suggest to consider an NH population for this purpose.

-----Studies using this DCT of PH are currently under review or are being developed (January 2023).

These questionnaires reflect one specific perspective on PH. In line with our DCT definition for PH, we intend to combine a number of these questionnaires into one instrument. For this we need to investigate which items predict best if someone is afflicted by PH. This study is now (January 2023) underway. Previous validation research for PH did not involve Item Response Theory techniques. We make use of IRT to make the best selection of cue valid items from the different measurement instruments for PH. These items and instruments have been developed within the three perspectives on PH (sex addiction, hypersexual disorder, compulsive sexual behavior disorder). IRT might help to decide on what characteristics best define PH.

2) Dynamical assessment - As specified in the definition, we see PH as driven by high sexual desire in combination with emotion dysregulation. These dynamical and fluctuating processes involved in PH we see as underlying the more permanent outcomes (each of the ten characteristics of PH). Experience Sampling Method (ESM) techniques are most optimal to assess these processes, as ESM is an ecologically valid method that is capable to assess fluctuations in sexual desire and emotions and link these to sexual activity in temporal analyses. Currently, a number of items are involved in measuring sexual desire and emotions with ESM techniques. Response Process Evaluations (Wolf et al., 2019) of these items needs to be undertaken still.`));

The perceived approval for a given social referent combines multiplicatively with the motivation to comply with that referent (dct:motivationToComply_73dnt5zf) into an injunctive norm belief (dct:injNorms_belief_73dnt5zg).`));

See dct:threat_susceptibility_79n2fh4s and dct:threat_severity_79n2fh4r for instructions for developing measurement instruments for these subconstructs. The resulting measurements express the degree of susceptibility and severity as a numeric score which, subsequently, can be multiplicated to estimate an individual's perception of the level of risk associated with a threat.

Instead of multiplying the two subcomponents, threat susceptibility and threat severity are also summed by some risk perception measures, e.g. the 12-item Risk Behaviour Diagnosis (RBD) Scale (Witte et al., 1995) includes 3 items measuring threat susceptibility and 3 items measuring threat severity on a 5-point Likert scale. Together these 6 (summed) items scores determine a participant's risk perception (there named "perceived threat").

(2011) distinguised four distinct approaches to the measurement of self-control: executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, selfreport questionnaires, and informant-report questionnaires. 

Among the self- and informant-report questionnaires, over 100 unique instruments were  discerned (Duckwort et al., 2011). Items on these questionnaires suggest considerable heterogeneity in the underlying constructs assessed. However, Duckwort et al. (2011) found that urgency (the inability to override strong impulses, e.g., ‚ÄúI have trouble controlling my impulses‚Äù), (lack of) premeditation (acting before thinking , e.g., ‚ÄúMy thinking is usually careful and purposeful‚Äù ), and (lack of) perseverance (the inability to focus on boring or difficult tasks, e.g., ‚ÄúI tend to give up easily‚Äù) are three central and related features of self-control. Therefore, when self-constructing an instrument to assess self-control, these three facets of self-control should be included. Moreover, for behaviour change, self-control related to a specific behaviour or object is of greater interest than self-control as a trait (i.e. stable across time and situations). Therefore, in a behaviour change setting, questionnaire items should refer to the specific behaviour or object of interest.  

Impulsivity can be regarded as the converse of self-control. Questionnaire items that attempt to measure self-control often present mutually exclusive responses. One response is aligned with long-term goals and standards, while the alternative response is more gratifying or automatic in the short-term. Self-controlled individuals tend to choose the first response, whereas impulsive individuals tend to choose the latter response.

If impulsivity is regarded as the converse of self-control, the same instrument used to assess impulsivity (see dct:impulse_79n2r0t0) can potentially also be used to measure self-control. However, the scoring for each questionnaire item should be reversed, i.e. if a high score on an item indicates a high level of impulsivity, it indicates a low level of self-control. For example: "When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR I act on the spur of the moment" with responses ranging from "Totally agree" (=5) to "Totally disagree" (=1) on a 5-point Likert scale. A high score (=5) here is indicative of a high level of impulsivity and a low level of self-control.

For self-report asessment, a statement such as "When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR...." can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of self-control. For example: "When it comes to smoking cigarettes... 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don't manage to plan my behaviour; 4) I act on the spur of the moment; 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions; 6) I afterwards frequently regret that I smoked. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "totally agree" to "totally disagree".

Beside behaviour- or object-related self-control, self-control as a trait can be measured. In fact, most self-control instruments measure self-control as a trait (i.e. stable across time and situations). Furthermore, beside selfreport questionnaires, executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, and informant-report questionnaires are used to measure self-control. Duckwort et al.

This set of attributes together form one‚Äôs general self-identity (i.e. unrelated to specific behaviors). However, most of these attributes are relatively trivial (e.g. all humans have a brain, but brains are usually not part of their self-identity). How central a given attribute is to one‚Äôs self-identity in general (its centrality) can depend on the degree to which it is perceived to distinguish one from others, confers positive characteristics, or is instrumental. For example, health is seen as desirable, so being ‚Äòa healthy eater‚Äô is desirable. Similarly, if sophistication is seen as desirable, and having well-developed tastes are seen as indicative of sophistication, then being somebody who is very picky about one‚Äôs coffee blends and preparation methods can be seen as desirable. As a final example of an instrumental function of self-identity, being ‚Äòan addict‚Äô can be used to excuse relapse.

Also, a given attribute can be more or less related to a given target behavior (e.g. being a ‚Äòvegan‚Äô is intrinsically related to eating behaviors). Given that one‚Äôs self-identity is defined as all these attributes that pertain to one‚Äôs self (weighted by their centrality), it follows that for different people, a given target behavior can be differentially relevant to their self-identity. In terms of operationalizations, this implies that this relevance of a behavior to one‚Äôs self-identity should be what is measured (note that this is not the same as general relevance of a behavior).`));

Therefore, to map the construct content for a given target behavior, for each attribute dimension along which self-identification can occur, two things have to be measured.

2) An alternative way to assess an individual's self-monitoring behaviour is to ask participants to keep a diary or use a mobile app (e.g. ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) ), internet program, or technical device to keep track of their self-monitoring actions with respect to the target behaviour, e.g. by asking youngsters to make a report each time they are aware to be exposed to music that is too loud (> 100 decibel) during a night out with the help of a mobile app. By asking people to report their self-monitoring behaviour, this behaviour, however, changes and is no longer a reflection of a person's actual self-monitoring behaviour.

Items to measure self-reported self-monitoring with respect to a particular (health) behaviour are, for example: "By counting the number of alcoholic drinks, I know exactly how much alcohol I consume during a night clubbing" or "I use a diary or mobile app to track my daily food consumption". Response can be either dichotomous (yes/no) or three response options can be provided ("Does not apply", "More or less", "Does apply").

Participants may also be asked to keep a diary or use a mobile app, internet program, or technical device to keep track of their self-monitoring actions with respect to the target behaviour, e.g. by asking youngsters to make a report each time they are aware to be exposed to music that is too loud (> 100 decibel) during a night out with the help of a mobile app. However, by asking people to monitor their self-monitoring behaviour, this behaviour changes and is no longer a reflection of a person's actual self-monitoring behaviour. 

Note that self-monitoring as a personal capacity is the topic of interest here. Asking a person (e.g. a patient) to self-monitor his or her (health) behaviour may yield valuable information that other measurement methods (e.g. questionniare, interview) possibly can not provide, e.g. by keeping track of the activity and sleeping patterns of bipolar patients the development of the disease can be predicted and altered. Self-monitoring is also a valuable behaviour change technique; by increasing insight in their actions, people may be instigated to modify their (problem) behaviour. However, as said, self-monitoring as individual skill, and not self-monitoring as research method or behaviour change technique, is of interest here.

The term "self-monitoring" is also used in popular language and research to describe the personality trait along which people differ in their abilities and desires to change their self-presentations, expressive behaviour, and nonverbal affective displays. This is a different construct from the one discussed here and should not be coded as such. The Self Monitoring Scale (Snyder et al, 1974) is a questionnaire that is used to measure this construct.`));

Note that most instruments that measure self-standards are not suited to use for the design of behaviour change interventions, as they assess self-standards in relation to self-discrepancy (i.e. the degree of dissimilarity between self-standards and the actual self). Outcomes of these instruments reflect the perceived degree of actualization of an individual's self-standards. Although self-discrepancy may operate as an incentive for engagement in the target behaviour, the self-standards they relate to are trait-like and, thus, hard to change.

In contrast, an individual's perceptions of how his or her self-standards relate to the target behaviour may be easier to change and are, thus, a more appropriate goal for behaviour change interventions. Bear in mind that in this latter case the self-standard itself is not changed, 'solely' an individual's perceptions how the self-standard relates to the particular behaviour. For example, the use of role models and other BCTs may help to change these perceptions.

Responses on these items range from "Very unwilling" to "Very willing" on a 5- or 7-point Likert scale.

Alternatively, following the scenario description, participants are asked to indicate the likelihood they would engage in the risk behaviour, with repsonses ranging from "Very unlikely" to "Very likely" on a 5- or 7-point Likert scale.

Scores on the different items measuring behavioural willingness can subsequently be summed or averaged. 

For example, Molloy et al. (2019) measured willingness to use Nonmedical Prescription Stimulants (NPS) for academic reasons by asking participants to consider various hypothetical scenarios. The first scenario described a friend offering free prescription stimulants to study for a big, upcoming exam. Participants indicated how willing they would be to: (1) Take the pills, (2) Take the pills and ask for extra to use for another exam or paper, or (3) Tell the friend no thank you (reverse-coded). 

Davies et al. (2017) measured willingness to drink in a similar fashion, and used three hypothetical scenarios; a family wedding, a house party, and at the park. Participants were asked how likely it was that they would (1) take a drink and drink it, from 1 ("Unlikely") to 7 ("Highly likely"); and (2) say no thanks, from 1 ("Unlikely") to 7 ("Likely") (reverse scored).

Howell et al (2017) measured willingness to engage in risky sun behaviour by asking participants to assume there is no sunscreen, and then to respond how willing they would be to: (1) go to the beach with friends, (2) decline an invitation to go to the beach with friends (reverse coded). Participants responded on a scale ranging from "Very unwilling" (=1) to "Very willing" (=7).

Davies et al. (2017) expressed that a pilot study revealed that use of the verb "willing to" was difficult to understand for young adults. Therefore, (young) participants were asked to indicate the "likelihood" they would engage in a behaviour. Ideally thus the phrasing of items using "willing to" (or similar) should be first tested among the target population in a pilot study.

Fishbein & Ajzen (2011) criticize the use and measurement of behavioural willingness and state that asking people whether they would or would not engage in a certain risk behaviour (e.g. unprotected sex) under certain circumstances may simply measure a more specific intention than the intention to perform these behaviours in general. `));
