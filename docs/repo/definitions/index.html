If the target behaviour is defined at a very high level of specificity, the action plan may also concern performance of the target behaviour itself.</p>
<p>An action plan is defined as a representation of the plan to perform the plan‚Äôs target behavior 1) at a specific time (when; temporal); 2) at a specific location or situation (where; contextual); and 3) in a specific way (how; operational). An incomplete action plan, for example only specifying the contextual or operational aspect, is still considered an action plan, and therefore, the ‚Äòquality‚Äô/‚Äòstrength‚Äô of action plans is variable.</p>
<p>Representations of aspects of a plan to carry out one or more (sub)behaviors are not action plans: action plans must always represent one or more of the three aspects (contextual, temporal, or operational).</p>

<p>The perceived power of a condition refers to the perceived impact the presence of a condition has on one‚Äôs autonomy. This impact can be perceived to be anywhere from very negative (if the condition is a barrier), through zero if the condition is perceived to have no impact on one‚Äôs autonomy regardless of whether it is perceived to be present, to very positive (if the condition is a facilitator). Note that the perception as to whether the condition is present or not is its perceived presence (dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr).</p>
<p>According to the Reasoned Action Approach, perceptions about the power of conditions combine multiplicatively with perceptions about the presence of conditions (see dct:autonomy_conditionPresence_73dnt5zr) into autonomy beliefs (see dct:autonomy_belief_73dnt5zt).</p>
Examples of the perceived power of a condition are the perception that having to ask for condoms at the counter obstructs buying them; the perception that rain obstructs going for a run; the perception that if food is expensive, that is a barrier to buying it; the perception that paying for STI tests is a barrier to get tested; and the perception that if anticonception is not widely available, it cannot be obtained and used.

<p>The perceived presence of a condition refers to the perceived probability that a condition will be present that may have some power to facilitate or obstruct successfully accomplishing the target behavior. Such conditions are perceived to be external to the individuals direct control (though they may in reality be internal conditions; for example, addicts may perceive their craving to be irresistible, and as such, a condition they have no control over and that negatively impacts their autonomy). Facilitating or obstructing factors that are perceived to be internal (i.e.&nbsp;that an individual can learn over time) are subskills (see dct:capacity_subskillPresence_73dnt5zy).</p>
<p>Each perceived presence of a condition concerns the absence or presence of one condition.

</td>

<p>An experiential attitude belief evaluation is the evaluation as positive or negative (i.e.&nbsp;desirable or undesirable) of one specific experiential potential consequence of a behavior. The experiential nature of this evaluation means that this concerns mostly expected experiences and sensations, such as pleasure or pain. Consequences that render the target behavior less or more instrumental given more long-term goals are captured in instrumental attitude and the underlying beliefs (see dct:expAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z1 and dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6 for more details about this distinction).</p>
<p>According to the Reasoned Action Approach, experiential attitude belief evaluations combine multiplicatively with experiential attitude belief expectations (see dct:expAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z1) into experiential attitude beliefs (see dct:expAttitude_belief_73dnt5z3).</p>
Examples of experiential attitude belief evaluations are (note that the examples provided for the experiential attitude belief expectations should probably be read first, see dct:expAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z1): the degree to which one finds it pleasant to sit down during a bus journey to the city centre; the evaluation of watching the scenery as desirable; one‚Äôs evaluation of a pizza‚Äôs taste as nice; one appraising a relaxed feeling as pleasant; one enjoying the sensation of sex without a condom.

<p>An experiential attitude belief expectation is the expectation of how probable (i.e.&nbsp;unlikely versus likely) it is that engaging in the target behavior will cause one specific experiential potential consequence to come about. The experiential nature of this expectation means that these expected consequences must concern experiences and sensations, such as pleasure or pain.</p>
<p>Each experiential attitude belief expectation covers one specific acute hedonic expectation, disconnected from potential long-term consequences the target behavior may have. Experiential attitude belief expectations always refer to immediately experienced consequences of a behavior. Expectations about consequences that render the target behavior less or more desirable without the immediate experiential effects of the behavior playing a role are captured in instrumental attitude belief expectations (see dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6).</p>
<p>According to the Reasoned Action Approach, experiential attitude belief expectations combine multiplicatively with experiential attitude belief evaluations (see dct:expAttitude_evaluation_73dnt5z2) into experiental attitude beliefs (see dct:expAttitude_belief_73dnt5z3).</p>
Examples of experiential attitude belief expectations are: the expectation that taking the bus to the city centre will allow one to sit down during the journey, which one finds a pleasant feeling; the expectation that walking to the city centre will allow one to watch the scenery, which one enjoys; the expectation that eating a pizza will taste nice; the expectation that going for a run will feel relaxing; and the expectation that having sex without a condom will feel more pleasant than having sex with a condom.

People may be motivated to behave in accordance with what they believe others think they should do (injunctive norms) because the social agent has the power to reward or punish them, because the agent has the right to request it, because the agent is an expert, or because they want to be like the agent. The operation of reward, coercive, and legitimate power all imply that the social agent expects a particular kind of behavior; that is, it implies an injunctive norm.

Beliefs are defined as the subjective probability that an object has a certain attribute, where ‚Äòobject‚Äô and ‚Äòattribute‚Äô are used in the generic sense, and refer to any discriminable aspect of an individual‚Äôs world. Conform the expectancy-value model of attitude, beliefs are the product of the expectation that engaging in a behavior will have a given consequence and the evaluation of that consequence as (very) negative or (very) positive. Instrumental attitude beliefs concern beliefs about consequences of engaging in the behavior for achieving one‚Äôs goals.

<p>An instrumental attitude belief evaluation is the evaluation as positive or negative (i.e.&nbsp;desirable or undesirable) of one specific instrumental potential consequence of a behavior. The instrumental nature of this evaluation means that this these evaluations contain information about people‚Äôs longer term goals. Consequences that concern experiences and sensations, such as pleasure or pain, are captured in experiential attitude and the underlying beliefs (see dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6 and dct:expAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z1 for more details about this distinction).</p>
<p>According to the Reasoned Action Approach, instrumental attitude belief evaluations combine multiplicatively with instrumental attitude belief expectations (see dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6) into instrumental attitude beliefs (see dct:instrAttitude_belief_73dnt5z8).</p>
Examples of instrumental attitude belief evaluations are (note that the examples provided for the instrumental attitude belief expectations should probably be read first, see dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6): the degree to which one evaluates the expectation that one saves time by taking the bus to the city center as positive; the extent to which one considers it desirable that exercising will contribute to one‚Äôs goal of being healthy (assuming one holds that expectation, which is captured by dct:instrAttitude_expectation_73dnt5z6); whether somebody likes to prevent starving, a goal that eating a pizza contributes to; one‚Äôs evaluation of burning calories (an expectation one may have of the behavior going for a run); and whether somebody wants to produce offspring.

<p>An instrumental attitude belief expectation is the expectation of how probable (i.e.&nbsp;unlikely versus likely) it is that engaging in the target behavior will cause one specific instrumental potential consequence to come about.

<p>Each instrumental attitude belief expectation covers one specific long-term consequence, disconnected from acute hedonic consequences the target behavior may have. Instrumental attitude belief expectations always refer to consequences that cause a behavior to contribute more or less to goals an individual has.

Examples of instrumental attitude belief expectations are: the expectation that taking the bus to the city centre will save time, which contributes to the goal of being punctual; the expectation that walking to the city centre will allow one to exercise, which contributes to the goal of being healthy; the expectation that eating a pizza will prevent one from starving, which contributes to the goal of surviving; the expectation that going for a run will burn calories, which contributes to one‚Äôs goal of losing weight; and the expectation that having sex without a condom is more likely to lead to conception, which is required to achieve one‚Äôs goal of producing offspring.

</td>

<p>Problematic Hypersexuality (PH) is defined as the experience of distress and negative consequences due to hypersexual urges and behavior - to the extent that the experience of PH causes the individual to at least consider seeking help. The construct of PH we base on the common and unique criteria (ten in total) found in three perspectives on PH.</p>
<p>‚Äî- Before we present these ten criteria we distilled from the three perspectives, we note that the three perspectives come as diagnostic systems, while our definition of PH must be taken as a construct definition for research. This means, among others, that what are called ‚Äòcriteria‚Äô within the diagnostic systems, we call ‚Äòcharacteristics‚Äô. With this Decentralized Construct Taxonomy (DCT) definition on PH we hope to define as clearly as possible what we mean by PH in our studies (references to the studies using this definition can be found under ‚ÄòComments‚Äô). As our research progresses, the DCT definition of PH might change. Also, others might use other but similar constructs that can be equally valid, if made explicit. Current research practices often suffer from hidden heterogeneity: definitions are not made explicit or are imprecise. Often constructs that bear the same name, prove to differ in small but important details. Reasons to adhere to explicit heterogeneity in definitions of constructs are explained in more detail here: (Peters &amp; Crutzen, 2022, https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8tpcv).</p>
<p>‚Äî- We now return to the DCT definition of PH. The three diagnostic perspectives on PH we make use of, are: 1) Sex addiction; 2) Hypersexual Disorder; and 3) Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder. The ten characteristics of PH we apply in this DCT of PH are based on 6 overlapping criteria and 4 unique criteria for PH retrieved from these three perspectives. The 6 overlapping criteria for PH we retrieved, are: 1) Intense focus on and preoccupation with sex; 2) Repetitive sexual acitivities leading to neglect of selfcare and responsibilities; 3) Negative consequences in one or more life domains; 4) Disregard of risk of harm to self or others: 5) Failed attempts to stop the sexual behavior; and 6) Continue PH behavior despite negative consequences. From the ‚Äòsex addiction‚Äô perspective we retrieved the following criteria: 7) Tolerance (the need to increase sexual intenstiy of frequency); and 8) Withdrawal symptoms (e.g.&nbsp;restlessness). From the ‚Äòhypersexual disorder‚Äô perspective we retrieved: 9) Sex used to cope with dysphoric mood states or stressful life events. From the ‚Äòcompulsive sexual behavior disorder‚Äô perspective we retrieved: 10) Continue PH behavior despite loss of pleasure in sex. These ten potentially cue valid characteristics of PH we consider as more permanent and relatively stable. With cue valid we mean: to a greater or lesser degree uniquely pertaining to hypersexuality. IRT validation studies can decide on the importance of each of these characteristics in assessing PH and are able to assess cue validity when relevant subpopulations are included in research. Furthermore, we consider PH to be ruled by two drivers: 1) high sexual desire; and 2) emotion dysregulation with regard to sexuality (Kingston, 2018; specifies these drivers as ‚Äòdimensions‚Äô). These two drivers we see as necessary for PH to occur but not as sufficient for PH to be the case. The ten characteristics are connected to the two drivers as outcomes are connected to processes. The process in PH that is maintained by the two drivers is that of a vicious circle- we hypothesize. Negative feelings (e.g.&nbsp;shame) lead to sexually acting out in order to cope with them. The sexual acting out reinforces shame, thus increasing the risk of a new cycle of shame and sexual acting out. Our investigations of this vicious circle is underway but at the time not conclusive. Therefore, this DCT of PH should be considered as preliminary and open to change. If a vicious circle for PH is not confirmed - or even disconfirmed - this will lead to a different DCT for PH. If a vicious circle is confirmed, this might lead to a more detailed description of its nature, and this too will lead to an adaptation of this DCT for PH.</p>
<p>‚Äî- To conclude this definition: we consider Problematic Hypersexuality as delineated from Non-problematic Hypersexuality (NH). By NH we mean the experience of hypersexuality without enduring distress or negative consequences. Hypersexuality in general - in short defined as taking great interest in experiencing sexuality - is the overarching concept, binding NH and PH together. In the future both NH and Hypersexuality might be awarded their own DCT.</p>
<p>‚Äî- We offer the following figure as an overview of this DCT definition of PH and note that cue valid characteristics are best established using IRT validation, while measuring driving processes of PH can best be done using ESM techniques: https://osf.io/89ha7 Both research methodologies (IRT and ESM) will profit from comparing a PH populations with relevant other populations and we suggest to consider an NH population for this purpose.</p>
<p>‚Äî‚ÄìStudies using this DCT of PH are currently under review or are being developed (January 2023).</p>

<td>
<p>People form representations of the world, and some of those representations pertain to the self. This set of attributes together form one‚Äôs general self-identity (i.e.&nbsp;unrelated to specific behaviors). However, most of these attributes are relatively trivial (e.g.&nbsp;all humans have a brain, but brains are usually not part of their self-identity). How central a given attribute is to one‚Äôs self-identity in general (its centrality) can depend on the degree to which it is perceived to distinguish one from others, confers positive characteristics, or is instrumental. For example, health is seen as desirable, so being ‚Äòa healthy eater‚Äô is desirable. Similarly, if sophistication is seen as desirable, and having well-developed tastes are seen as indicative of sophistication, then being somebody who is very picky about one‚Äôs coffee blends and preparation methods can be seen as desirable. As a final example of an instrumental function of self-identity, being ‚Äòan addict‚Äô can be used to excuse relapse.</p>
Also, a given attribute can be more or less related to a given target behavior (e.g.&nbsp;being a ‚Äòvegan‚Äô is intrinsically related to eating behaviors). Given that one‚Äôs self-identity is defined as all these attributes that pertain to one‚Äôs self (weighted by their centrality), it follows that for different people, a given target behavior can be differentially relevant to their self-identity. In terms of operationalizations, this implies that this relevance of a behavior to one‚Äôs self-identity should be what is measured (note that this is not the same as general relevance of a behavior).
