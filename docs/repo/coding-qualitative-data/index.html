Whether these elicited control beliefs constitute actual (real) barriers or facilitators may be subsequently verified by the researchers, may form the starting point for the development of a skills test or observational coding scheme, or may help gathering the right background information (see: ‚Äòmeasure_dev‚Äô of this same DCT for more information).

</td>
<td>
<p>Expressions that demonstrate or imply the presence of self-control. In the context of behaviour change interventions (i.e.&nbsp;health behaviour changes), this self-control is regarded with respect to a specific behaviour or object.</p>
<p>Trait self-control, i.e.&nbsp;self-control across situations, not specifically linked to a particular behaviour or object, is usually not the focus of interest. Therefore, expressions indicative of self-control should be coded as such only when they concern the behaviour or object of interest, unless beforehand another decision has been made.</p>
<p>Expressions indicative of the presence of self-control may contain phrases such as ‚ÄúI did not succumb to temptation X because I wanted to achieve goal X‚Äù and ‚ÄúI sticked to my plan, but sometimes it was difficult‚Äù.</p>
Expressions indicative of impulsivity should be coded as dct:impulse_79n2r0t0. Expressions that refer to an individual‚Äôs perceptions of the degree to which he/she is capable of, or has control over, performing a given behaviour, should be coded as dct:perceivedBehavioralControl_73dnt603.
