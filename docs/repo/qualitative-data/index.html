<p>Conduct a qualitative study where participants are individually interviewed in a free-response format, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding. In this qualitative study, ask participants for their performance of the target behaviour. The target behaviour should be described unequivocally and consistent, addressing action, target, context, time, and level of generality. As an introduction to the question a definition of the target behaviour can be provided.</p>
An example can be: ‘Our definition of “exercise” is “all physical activity strenuous enough to make you sweat”. Can you tell me if you currently exercise for at least 20 minutes, three times per week?’. An alternative question could be: ‘In the past 3 months, how often have you exercised for at least 20 minutes, three times per week?’. Note that this latter question measures past behaviour. In practice, asking about current behaviour most often concerns a retrospective asessment of behaviour until the moment of assessment.

</td>
<td>
<p>Conduct a qualitative study where participants are interviewed, and the interviews are either recorded and transcribed, or notes are kept. These sources are then coded using the instruction for aspect coding.</p>
<p>In this qualitative study, the formulation of the question(s) depends on the nature of the behaviour, i.e.&nbsp;engagement in the behaviour can be conceived as binary (i.e.&nbsp;one either does or does not engage in the target behaviour, e.g.&nbsp;getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter of frequency (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour with a frequency from zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g.&nbsp;the frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter of intensity (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour to a degree from zero up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g.&nbsp;the amount of kilocalories one consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g.&nbsp;how frequently one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).</p>
<p>If engagement in the behaviour is conceived as binary, the interviewer can ask a question in the following fashion: “Do you you perform BEHAVIOUR X?”, “Do you you perform BEHAVIOUR X when at location X?”, or “Did you you perform BEHAVIOUR X during period X?”.</p>
<p>If the interviewer is interested in the frequency the behaviour is performed, he/she can ask a question in the following fashion: “During period X, how many days did you perform BEHAVIOUR X?” or “When you were at location X, how many times did you perform BEHAVIOUR X?”.</p>
<p>If the intensity of performance of the behaviour is the focus of interest, the interviewer can ask a question in the following fashion: “On the days you performed BEHAVIOUR X during period X, how much/many did you take/consume?” or “On the days you performed BEHAVIOUR X during period X, how long did you engage in BEHAVIOUR X?”</p>
If both the frequency and intensity of engagement in the behaviour is of interest, the interviewer can formulate questions in the following way: “During period X, how many days did you perform BEHAVIOUR X and for how long?” or “During period X, how many days did you perform BEHAVIOUR X and how much/many did you take/consume each time?”.

An SIFFM-item for the assessment of extraversion is: “Would you describe yourself as a leader?” [If yes:] “Please give me some examples of yourself as a leader?” [After response] “Do others ever consider you to be bossy or domineering?’’.

We note that the vicious circle hypothesized for PH in general - as described in this DCT definition for PH - is an integral part of the coding structure. For other groups (e.g.&nbsp;NH and PH pornusers), a similar coding structure for PH (in presented in blue block) will be used, also including a vicious circle. However, the overall structure will be different, as pornuse and chemsex generally take place in very different settings (and this setting or context is part of the coding structure as well, as is exemplified in the a priori coding structure for the chemsex study).
