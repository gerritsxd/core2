</td>
<td>
<p>Action plans composites represent the degree action plans are present or absent for the target behaviour. In research, such an overall overview, either graphically or numerically represented, is generally absent.</p>
<p>Therefore, action plans composites have to be deduced from the scores on the different action plan items. One way of doing is, is by creating an overall score by summing the scores of all items measuring action plans (see “measure_dev” for instruction for dichotomous scored items).</p>
Participants’ overall score expresses the degree action plans for the subbehaviours are present. A high score (e.g.&nbsp;6 out of 7) makes performance of the target behaviour more likely.

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the presence of action plans for performance of subbehaviours of the target behaviour. In some instances the target behaviour is defined at a very high level of specificity. In that case, dividing the target behaviour into subbehaviours is not possible or redundant, and action plans for performance of the target behaviour itself are measured.</p>
<p>The presence of action plans, ideally, is measured with dichotomous items asking if a specific plan is present (yes/no) for performance of a subbehaviour of the target behaviour. Answers on these items express if the participant has a plan to perform the subbehaviour according to the description provided. Items should specify when, where, and how the particular subbehaviour is performed.</p>
<p>Items measuring the presence of action plans can start with a question stem that presents the issue and situation about which the question is asking, followed by a detailed description of an action plan. Participants are askes to indicate if they have (yes/no) this specific action plan.</p>
<p>An example of a question stem followed by three items measuring the presence of three separate action plans for the target behaviour “protecting skin against UV radiation” is:</p>
<p>When you are going on a day trip this summer and large parts of your skin will be uncovered (e.g.&nbsp;at the pool or beach)…. 1) Do you plan to check one day or more beforehand if you have sunscreen at home? 2) Do you plan to check if you have sunscreen with you before leaving on the day trip? 3) Do you plan to use sunscreen every 2 hours?</p>
<p>Measures of action plans often provide answer options that express the likelihood the participant expects to perform the decribed behaviour, or the level of agreement or diagreement with performance of the behaviour; i.e.&nbsp;with anchors “Very likely” vs “Very unlikely” and “Totally agree” vs “Totally diagree” on a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. For example: “When you are going to a pop concert, music festival, or dance/house event, do you plan to take ear plugs with you?”, with answers ranging from “Very likely” vs “Very unlikely” on a 5-point scale. These items may not measure (the presence of) action plans, but another construct, most likely expectations, and should be coded as such.</p>

<p>Anticipated regret from not engaging in the target behaviour is inaction regret (see dct:inaction_regret_79n2r0t0).</p>

<p>Most research uses perceived behavioural control (see dct:perceivedBehavioralControl_73dnt603) as a proxy of actual control, e.g.&nbsp;questions asessing control beliefs and direct measurements of perceived behavioural control are regarded to reflect actual control.</p>
In some instances, the reality of control beliefs may be objectively verified by the researchers, e.g.&nbsp;a check of the map and neighboorhood may prove or disapprove the belief that no green areas are available for outdoor physical activities. Furthermore, researchers may apply tests to assess the presence of skills essential for the enactment of the target behaviour. Background factors relevant for performance of the target behaviour, such as highest level of education achieved, may also give an indication of the level of actual control.

</td>
<td>
<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the expectation that enagement or non-engagement in the target behaviour will lead to feelings of regret. In most research, it is not specified whether the questions used measure action or inaction regret (the two forms in which anticipated regret may appear), and thus (if of interest) has to be deduced from the formulation of the questions. In most cases either action or inaction regret is used. Which one of the two is used, is mostly guided by the target behaviour.</p>
For example in the study “Deciding to exercise: The role of anticipated regret” (Abraham &amp; Sheeran, 2004), the target behaviour is “exercising at least six times over the next two weeks”, and the two items measuring anticipated regret both assess action regret (although the authors do no mention such a specification): “If I did not exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, I would feel regret” and “‘If I did not exercise at least six times in the next two weeks, I would feel upset’, witch anchors”definitely no” and “definitely yes” for both items.

<p>Attitude towards noise is a specific subtype of attitude (see dct: attitude_73dnt5zc).

<p>When “attitude towards noise” is assessed it is important that this attitude is measured in diverse situations, i.e.&nbsp;the situations must refer to both voluntarily and involuntarily chosen sources of loud noise (e.g.&nbsp;both pop concerts and traffic noise).</p>

<p>People’s perception of their behaviour meeting a guideline can be asssessed with a single question, with yes/no response options.</p>
Objective measures of behaviour are observation and/or the tracking/monitoring of behaviour with mobile apps and technical devices such as accelerometers.

These outcomes are subsequently compared with participants’ perception of their behaviour meeting the guideline.

<p>Ideally, the target behaviour is described unequivocally and consistent in the questions and instructions for participants, and in publications resulting from the research. Moreover, the target behaviour should be described as specific as possible, i.e.&nbsp;specifying action, target, context, and time - and address the level of generality of the behaviour. Diverging and/or ambiguous formulations of the target behaviour confound and limit the applicability of study results.</p>
For example ‘exercising for at least 20 minutes, three times per week, for the next 3 months’ could be a viable target behaviour. However, the definition of ‘exercising’ should specified, as participants be may have different views of what comprises ‘exercising’. When a target behaviour is not sufficiently defined, or when various definitions are used, this has to be taken into account when assessing the quality of the study.

<p>Instruments that measure observable behaviour. The prefered instruments for this purpose are observation by trained observers using a valid and reliable reporting protocol and/or the use of technical measures and devices to record and track behaviour during particular events and over time. Self-report of behaviour assessed by questionniares or interviews are alternative options. However, one should take into account that these latter methods by definition measure a subjective representation of behaviour. Moreover, whereas there is general agreement about the definition of a specific behaviour (“running”), this is not the case when asking about a broad behavioural category, such as “exercising”. To assess a category of behaviours via self-report, therefore, a clear definition of the category in question must be provided, specifying action, target, context, and time.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of the behaviour, engagement in the behaviour can be conceived as binary (i.e.&nbsp;one either does or does not engage in the target behaviour, e.g.&nbsp;getting tested for STIs every six months), a matter of frequency (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour with a frequency from zero up to a given feasible maximum frequency in a given timespan, e.g.&nbsp;the frequency with which one washes their hands conform the guidelines), a matter of intensity (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour to a degree from zero up to a given feasible maximum intensity, e.g.&nbsp;the amount of kilocalories one consumed in a meal), or a combination of these (i.e.&nbsp;one engages in the target behaviour with a given frequency and with a given intensity, e.g.&nbsp;how frequently one drinks alcohol, and how many grams of alcohol one consumes when one does).</p>
The composition of self-report instruments to measure behaviour, logically derive from the foregoing consideration regarding the nature of the behaviour of interest. For example, for a dichotomous response option (yes/no) the question can be formulated in the following way: “Did you get tested for STIs during the last six months?”. If the behaviour is a matter of frequency, multiple response options may be given, e.g.: “During the last seven days, how many days did you drink two or more alcoholic drinks?”, with response options ranging from 0 to 7.

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the degree to which performance of the target behaviour follows certain behavioural scripts. These fixed behavioural patters may be prompted by certain cues or certain situations.</p>
Questions measuring the presence of behavioural scripts for a particular behaviour can present different scenarios (each representing a particualr behavioural script) and ask whether the participant performs the target behaviour in this fashion, with “Very likely” and “Very unlikely” at the extreme ends of a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. For example “When I am at a club or festival, I usually get offered a couple of alcoholic drink from friends, even when I don’t aks for them”, “When I am at a club or festival and a stranger bumps into me, I don’t pay attention to it or start an argument, and I continue my way” and “When I am at a club or festival, I first walk around at the event to see who is there.”

<a href="../../repo/constructs/coping_79n2w1bj.html">Coping</a>
</td>

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the way individuals handle potentiially stressful situations. A broad range of (self-report) instruments exist to assess coping styles, e.g there are scales for members of various groups (adults, children, adolescents, elderly) and broad and situation-specific application (e.g.&nbsp;health-related issues). The COPE (Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989) is the most frequently used instrument for broad application, and also one of the most commonly used measures in situation-specific contexts (Kato, 2015).</p>
<p>The 60-item COPE consists of 15 subscales (e.g.&nbsp;“active coping” and “acceptance”). Individuals that participate in the COPE are asked to indicate on a 4-points scale what they usually do when they experience a stressful event (1 = I usually don’t do this at all, 2 = I usually do this a little bit, 3 = I usually do this a medium amount, 4 = I usually do this a lot). Examples of items used in the COPE are: “I get upset and let my emotions out”, “I laugh about the situation”, “I daydream about things other than this” and “I think hard about what steps to take”.</p>
<p>The COPE, in its original form, measures coping style across different types of stressors. However, researchers have also adapted the scale to assess coping in specific situations (e.g.&nbsp;by replacing “stressful event” by a more narrow description of a potentially stressful situation), or by using only a selection of the 15 subscales. The COPE does not have an overall score, and the authors do not endorse combining subscales or deducing a dominant coping style from the scores (Carver, 2013).</p>
Different ways are used to classify coping styles into higher-order families. Engagement and disengagement coping (see dct:engCoping and dct:disengCoping) is the higher-order structure used here. One should, however, take into account that the presence or absence of particular coping styles should be assessed at a higher level of specificity, e.g.&nbsp;coping styles pertaining to the 12 families identified by Skinner et al.&nbsp;(2003) or the 15 subscales of the COPE (Carver, 2013) should be selected. After an assessment is made at this higher level of specificity, subsequently one can potentially classify an individual’s dominant overall coping style as engagement (see dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengagement coping (see dct:disengCoping_79n2w1bk).

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure a so-called “disengagement” coping style (i.e.&nbsp;efforts to avoid confronting the threat or the stress-related emotions) when faced with stressful situations. A broad range of (self-report) instruments exist for this purpose, e.g the COPE (Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989).

Therefore, whether a particular coping style pertains to the higher-order class of engagement or disengament coping, should be decided based on factor analysis or an a priori categorization of each individual coping style as either falling under the umbrella of engagement (dct:engCoping_79n2r0sy) or disengament coping, with “responses that are oriented toward either the source of stress, or toward one’s emotions and thoughts” representing engagement coping, while “responses that are oriented away from the stressor or one’s emotions/thoughts” indicating the dominant presence of a disengagement coping style (Compas et al., 2001).

<p>“Ego depletion” is its original meaning (i.e.&nbsp;ego depletion is reduced performance on self-control tasks resulting from engaging in preceding tasks requiring self-control) as formulated by Baumeister et al.&nbsp;1994) is usually assessed by using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which participants engage in two consecutive tasks.</p>
<p>The range of situations and circumstances that may elicit “ego depletion” in the definition of the present DCT is broader. Moreover, it reflects an individual’s perception of situations and circumstances in which ego depletion occurs. This perception is not necessarily a reflection of actual ego depletion taking place. Therefore, the sequential-task experimental paradigm is not an appropriate method to measure the present construct.</p>
<p>To measure the broader meaning of ego depletion, questions are presented in which participants are asked to which extent they believe their ability is reduced to control dominant responses with respect to the target behaviour in the situation or circumstances described. For example: “Is your capacity to control the expression of vicious comments to friends or family reduced when preparing for an important test or exam?” or “Is your ability to control your exposure to loud music (e.g.&nbsp;by wearing ear plugs, restrict the volume, or keeping a distance from loudspeakers) reduced when under the influence of alcohol of drugs?”. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Severly reduced” to “Not reduced at all”.</p>
<p>Note that to accurately measure ego depletion, items have to match with the specific target behaviour and target group.</p>
Ego depletion, as defined in the present construct (dct:ego_depletion_79n2r0sy) can be regarded as a subconstruct of dct:capacity_73dnt602, i.e.&nbsp;it represents a temporary reduced capacity for self-control (dct:self_control_79n2fh4t), induced by the situation or by circumstances.

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure impulsivity related to a specific behaviour or object. For self-report asessment, a statement such as “When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR….” can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of impulsivity. For example: “When it comes to smoking cigarettes… 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don’t manage to plan my behaviour; 4) I act on the spur of the moment; 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions; 6) I afterwards frequently regret that I smoked. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from”totally agree” to “totally disagree”.</p>
<p>Alternatively, unique items can be created to measure behaviour- or object-related impulsivity, such as: “When I hear a good track, I just have to turn off the volume restriction” (for target behaviour “use volume restriction on music players”) with responses “totally agree” and “totally disagree” as anchors on a 5-point Likert scale.</p>
<p>Beside behaviour- or object-related impulsivity, impulsivity as a trait can be measured. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is the most commonly used self-report questionnaire for this pupose. Furthermore, numerous tests exist in which participants have to carry out an assignment or a series of assignments; among these tests the go-no go task, stop signal task (SST), Stroop task, and the continuous performance task (CPT) are most often utilized.</p>
Impulsivity can be regarded as the converse of self-control. Therefore, the same instrument to assess self control (see dct:self_control_XXX) can potentially be used to measure impulsivity. However, the scoring for the questionnaire items should be reversed (see dct:self_control_XXX for an example).

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the presence or absence of motivation for engagement in the target behaviour. In its simplest form, this can be measured with the question “Are you motivated to engage in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?” followed by either a dichotomous response option (“yes”/“no”) or a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Very Much” to “Not at all”.</p>
<p>Definitions and operationalisations of motivation vary greatly across studies. One influential theory on human motivation is self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985). According to this theory, different types of motivation underlie human behaviour. These different types of motivation are positioned on a continuum from high to low levels of self-determination, with intrinsic motivation and amotivation at the extreme ends. The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) (Guay et al., 2000) is a frequently used self-report instrument to assess which type of motivation dominates for a particular behaviour or activity (see dct:intrinsicBehaviour_79n2r0t0, dct:integratedBehaviour_79n2r0t0, dct:identifiedBehaviour_79n2r0t0, dct:introjBehaviour_79n2r0t0, and dct:extBehaviour_79n2r0sz).</p>
Questions that measure specific types of motivation (such as the questions used in the SIMS), and not motivation in general (for engagement in the target behaviour) should not be coded as dct:motivation_79n2fh4q, but should be given the code pertaining to the specific subconstruct measured (e.g.&nbsp;dct:extBehaviour_79n2r0sz).

<a href="../../repo/constructs/need_79n2fh4r.html">Need satisfaction</a>
</td>

<p>Numerous self-report instruments exist to measure need satisfaction. These instruments measure the degree needs are satisfied in a particular domain (e.g.&nbsp;work, relationship), the degree needs are satisfied by a particular activity (e.g.&nbsp;a certain type of sports), or they assess need satisfaction in general.</p>
<p>Instruments that measure need satisfaction most often assume that humans have universal needs. In particular, Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) and Maslow’s (1968) Hierarchy of Needs have instigated the development of instruments to measure the satisfaction of these universal needs. The Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS) (Gagné et al., 2003) and the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (BMPN) (Sheldon et al., 2012) measure needs from a SDT-perspective, while the Basic Need Satisfaction Inventory (BNSI) (Leidy et al., 1994)) adopts Maslow’s standpoint on human needs.</p>
<p>For behaviour change (e.g.&nbsp;instigating healthy lifestyle choices), measuring general, as well as measuring domain- or activity-specific need satisfaction may have its merits. For example, Timmerman et al.&nbsp;(2001) found that the lower the level of basic need satisfaction, the more likely one is engaged in emotional eating. Need satisfaction at this general level, however, is harder to change than needs being met by specific activities or in a narrow domain. Therefore, instruments pertaining to the latter category are preferably used.</p>
<p>Need satisfaction can be asssessed by following a series of four steps: Firstly, depending on the theoretical background one adheres to (e.g.&nbsp;SDT) a list of of universal needs is composed. Secondly, to measure whether these needs are met by the situation or activity of interest, for each of these needs a number of items are used to assess the level of needs satisfaction. Thirdly, the item sumscores for each need, and the overall sumcore of all needs together are calculated. Fourth, the degree individual needs and all need together are satisfied by an activity or situation can be deduced from the two sumscores.</p>
Need satisfaction in a particular domain can, for example, be assessed with the following sample items. These sample items pertain to the assessment of need satisfaction at work but (with slight adjustments) could also be used to measure need satisfaction in other domains or concerning specific activities. Participants are asked to indicate how true each statement is for them, with answer option ranging from “Not at all true” to “Very true” on a 7-point Likert scale: “I feel like I can make a lot of inputs to deciding how my job gets done”, “People at work care about me”, and “Most days I feel a sense of accomplishment from working”. These three items reflect what SDT regards as the three basic human needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence.

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure self-control related to a specific behaviour or object. For self-report asessment, a statement such as “When it comes to TARGET BEHAVIOUR….” can be composed, followed by a series of phrases that express behaviour considered indicative for the presence or absence of self-control. For example: “When it comes to smoking cigarettes… 1) I do it without thinking about it; 2) I am self controlled; 3) I don’t manage to plan my behaviour; 4) I act on the spur of the moment; 5) I often suddenly abandon my behavioural intentions; 6) I afterwards frequently regret that I smoked. Responses on these items can be given on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from”totally agree” to “totally disagree”.</p>
<p>Beside behaviour- or object-related self-control, self-control as a trait can be measured. In fact, most self-control instruments measure self-control as a trait (i.e.&nbsp;stable across time and situations). Furthermore, beside selfreport questionnaires, executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, and informant-report questionnaires are used to measure self-control. Duckwort et al.&nbsp;(2011) discerned over 100 unique self- and informant-report questionnaires. Items on these questionnaires suggest considerable heterogeneity in the underlying constructs assessed.</p>
If impulsivity is regarded as the converse of self-control, the same instrument to assess impulsivity (see dct:impulse_79n2r0t0) can potentially be used to measure self-control, applying reverse scoring.

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the degree to which an individual engages in self-monitoring with respect to the target behaviour. Items to measure self-reported self-monitoring with respect to a particular (health) behaviour are, for example: “By counting the number of alcoholic drinks, I know exactly how much alcohol I consume during a night clubbing” or “I use a diary or mobile app to track my daily food consumption”. Response can be either dichotomous (yes/no) or three response options can be provided (“Does not apply”, “More or less”, “Does apply”).</p>
<p>Participants may also be asked to keep a diary or use a mobile app, internet program, or technical device to keep track of their self-monitoring actions with respect to the target behaviour, e.g.&nbsp;by asking youngsters to make a report each time they are aware to be exposed to music that is too loud (&gt; 100 decibel) during a night out with the help of a mobile app. However, by asking people to monitor their self-monitoring behaviour, this behaviour changes and is no longer a reflection of a person’s actual self-monitoring behaviour.</p>
<p>Note that self-monitoring as a personal capacity is the topic of interest here. Asking a person (e.g.&nbsp;a patient) to self-monitor his or her (health) behaviour may yield valuable information that other measurement methods (e.g.&nbsp;questionniare, interview) possibly can not provide, e.g.&nbsp;by keeping track of the activity and sleeping patterns of bipolar patients the development of the disease can be predicted and altered. Self-monitoring is also a valuable behaviour change technique; by increasing insight in their actions, people may be instigated to modify their (problem) behaviour. However, as said, self-monitoring as individual skill, and not self-monitoring as research method or behaviour change technique, is of interest here.</p>
The term “self-monitoring” is also used in popular language and research to describe the personality trait along which people differ in their abilities and desires to change their self-presentations, expressive behaviour, and nonverbal affective displays. This is a different construct from the one discussed here and should not be coded as such. The Self Monitoring Scale (Snyder et al, 1974) is a questionnaire that is used to measure this construct.

<p>Questions or questionnaires that measure the degree a participant’s self-standards in- or decrease the likelihood of engagement in the target behaviour.</p>
<p>This can, for example, be assessed by presenting the following two questions (each consisting of six subquestions) to participants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What kind of person would you like to be? Assign a score from 1 to 6 to each of the following six descriptions. Each score is assigned once (i.e.&nbsp;a score of 6 for the description you would most want to be like and a score of 1 for the description you would least want to be like). [Six descriptions or traits are given - the choice and length of the descriptions is determined by the target behaviour and target population in question. For example: Assertive, Brilliant, Eloquent, Unpredictable, Athletic, and Resourceful.]</p></li>
<li><p>“Do you think a person that [include one of the six previous descriptions] would engage in TARGET BEHAVIOUR?” For each of the six descriptions the response options are: “Very likely”(=2), “Likely” (=1), “Not Likely or Unlikely” (=0), ““Unlikely” (-1), “Very unlikely” (-2).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The answers to question 1 and 2 are multiplied. This results in a maximum score of 42 and a minimum score of -42.</p>
<p>A high score indicates that a participant’s self-standards increase the likelihood that the TARGET BEHAVIOUR is performed, while a low score indicates that a participant’s self-standards decrease the likelihood that the TARGET BEHAVIOUR is performed).</p>
<p>Note that most instruments that measure self-standards are not suited to use for the design of behaviour change interventions, as they assess self-standards in relation to self-discrepancy (i.e.&nbsp;the degree of dissimilarity between self-standards and the actual self). Outcomes of these instruments reflect the perceived degree of actualization of an individual’s self-standards. Although self-discrepancy may operate as an incentive for engagement in the target behaviour, the self-standards they relate to are trait-like and, thus, hard to change.</p>
In contrast, an individual’s perceptions of how his or her self-standards relate to the target behaviour may be easier to change and are, thus, a more appropriate goal for behaviour change interventions. Bear in mind that in this latter case the self-standard itself is not changed, ‘solely’ an individual’s perceptions how the self-standard relates to the particular behaviour. For example, the use of role models and other BCTs may help to change these perceptions.

The sample items are from the Temptation to Use Drugs Scale (Di Clemente et al., 1994).</p>
<p>Another example is provided by Lazuras et al.&nbsp;(2010). They measured the situational temptation among athletes to use doping substances with the stem proposition “How much would you be tempted to use prohibited doping substances to enhance your performance this season,” followed by four items reflecting temptations to use prohibited performance-enhancing substances under different circumstances that potentially induce normative influence (“when your coach suggests so,” “when you believe that most colleagues of yours use prohibited substances,” “when you were told to enhance your performance,” and “when you prepare for an important game/competition”). Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all tempted, 5 = very much tempted).</p>
Note that the instructions and examples given above apply to the measurement of situational temptation. For the measurement of the susceptibility to temptations in general (i.e.&nbsp;as a trait) other instructions and instruments apply, e.g.&nbsp;the Susceptibility to Temptation Scale can be used.

<p>Willingness to engage in a risky behaviour is usually measured by asking participants to consider a hypothetical scenario and then to indicate their willingness to engage in a particular risk behaviour.

Responses can range from “Very unwilling” to “Very willing” or “Very unlikely” to “Very likely” on a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. Scores on the different items measuring behavioural willingness can subsequently be summed or averaged.</p>
<p>For example, Howell et al (2017) measured willingness to engage in risky sun behaviour by asking participants to assume there is no sunscreen, and then to respond how willing they would be to: (1) go to the beach with friends, (2) decline an invitation to go to the beach with friends (reverse coded). Participants responded on a scale ranging from “Very unwilling” (=1) to “Very willing” (=7).</p>
Fishbein &amp; Ajzen (2011) criticize the use and measurement of behavioural willingness and state that asking people whether they would or would not engage in a certain risk behaviour (e.g.&nbsp;unprotected sex) under certain circumstances may simply measure a more specific intention than the intention to perform these behaviours in general.
